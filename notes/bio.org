Steven has 25 years experience in the software industry in roles from Analyst Programmer through Tech Lead. He loves programming languages — including functional programming, type theory, compilers and runtime systems — and has a broad array of related interests including product development, software engineering, distributed systems, database systems and operating systems.

He tries and fails to keep up with all the latest ideas, tools and systems in the industry and is still searching for the holy grail to solve the software crisis … he thinks he's found it, but he's just not sure yet — more experimentation is required :).

When not thinking specifically about computation, he can sometimes be found thinking about philosophy, ethics, law, economics, mathematics, physics and human languages. Occasionally can be found playing guitar or chess.



Talk to him about hands-on engineering roles such as CTO, VP of Engineering, Tech Lead, Software Magician or Applied Logician. In the domain of highly scalable apps and services, DevOps/Agile/Lean, Continuous Delivery, self-organising teams, Cloud, PaaS, HTML5/JS/altJS, cross-platform mobile/web apps with high doses of enthusiasm, humour, sense, gentleness and Functional Programming.
