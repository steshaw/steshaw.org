[Category Theory 2.1: Functions, epimorphisms](https://youtu.be/O2lZkr-aAqk?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)

In set theory,

- an injective function is a 1-to-1 mapping.
- a surjective function is "onto". i.e. the image of the function covers the
  entire co-domain.

In CT, these notions abstract to:

- injective (function) = monoic morphism or monomorphism
- surjective (function) = epic morphism or epimorphism
