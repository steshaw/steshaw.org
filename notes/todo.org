* Port [[https://twitter.com/li_haoyi][Li Haoyi]]'s Scala-JS examples to PureScript.

  - https://gist.github.com/lihaoyi/9443f8e0ecc68d1058ad
  - then Idris
  - then Glorious GHCJS

  - Using Haskell for a startup.
  - rational software tooling.
  - PureScript.
  - To Scala or not to Scala, yep, that's the question.


* Original public todo.org

- Read "On Bullshit" "spoken word" as "performance art".
- Write an essay/book "On Money". inspired by "On Bullshit" and "On Assholes"
- Convert the [[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html][horrors of Bash]] to the wonders of Turtle Haskell
