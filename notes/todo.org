    - Yes, apparently. See [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-parser-combinators.html][Total Parser Combinators (paper)]]. This

      interesting. An undergraduate Cambridge student may be taking
      this up (overhead on #idris). Edwin Brady suggested that a total
      parser combinator library in Idris would ideally make use of the
      partial evaluator (see [[https://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/icfp10.pdf][this paper]]).

        #+begin_quote
        **It's second-class vs first-class that matters**

        That's not quite right. You seem to be assuming that you can
        always statically monomorphise universal polymorphism, but
        that is only true if polymorphism is second-class (*). And in
        that case, it is just as true for existential polymorphism
        (e.g., some SML compilers "monomorphise" modules routinely).
        As soon as you have first-class polymorphism, though (e.g.,
        higher-ranked polymorphic types), you cannot do that anymore,
        neither for universal nor for existential
        polymorphism. Furthermore, as naasking pointed out, you can
        encode existentials with universals then, so there really is
        no difference in the degree of static knowledge.  In short,
        the compile time vs run time distinction does not hinge on
        universal vs existential polymorphism, but on second-class vs
        first-class polymorphism (and existentials in Haskell happen
        to be first-class).  (*) And in fact, not even then, as
        Haskell's counter-example of polymorphic recursion shows --
        contrary to popular belief, type class polymorphism is not
        static in Haskell, not even in plain H'98. Common
        optimisations notwithstanding.

      Unfortunately, Girard found that this system [Martin-Löf first TT]

    #+begin_quote
    We consider the problem of providing formal support for working
    with abstract syntax involving variable binders. Gabbay and Pitts
    have shown in their work on Fraenkel-Mostowski (FM) set theory how
    to address this through first-class names: in this paper we
    present a dependent type theory for programming and reasoning with
    such names. Our development is based on a categorical
    axiomatisation of names, with freshness as its central notion. An
    associated adjunction captures constructions known from FM theory:
    the freshness quantifier N, name-binding, and unique choice of
    fresh names. The Schanuel topos -- the category underlying FM set
    theory -- is an instance of this axiomatisation. Working from the
    categorical structure, we define a dependent type theory which it
    models. This uses bunches to integrate the monoidal structure
    corresponding to freshness, from which we define novel
    multiplicative dependent products Π∗ and sums Σ∗, as well as a
    propositions-as-types generalisation H of the freshness
    quantifier.

     - Does [[https://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/mixml/][MixML]] go too far? i.e. is it "principled"?
       - You end up with initialisation ordering issues like in OOP.
   - Common extensions
     - separate compilation
     - first class modules

*** Modules and Dependently Typed Languages
  - Agda/Coq/Cayenne
  - [[http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/images/5/5e/Cayenne.pdf][Cayenne - a language with dependent types]]
  - Can dependent records do (like in Cayenne)?
    - surely dependended records don't help with separate compilation.
  - Agda seems to have a simple module system. See [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/talks/modules-061220.pdf][these slides]].
    #+begin_quote
    You don’t need a fancy module system ... and you tell me why I’m wrong.

*** Relationship with Type Classes
  - read modular type classes (MTC) in http://steshaw.org/plt/modules.
    - Update with "modular implicits" in OCaml.

        Kwangkeun Yi, Philip Wadler.
  - Kmett's type classes versus the world. i.e. global uniqueness of
    type classes. Kmett says he wants both type classes and an ML
    style module system.

** Demystify Advanced Functional Programming
  - recursion schemes

  - notes/slides/articles/courseware

** Demystify Compilers
  - Develop (literate) code, articles, slides, notes, articles.
  - [ ] [[https://github.com/steshaw/babyml][BabyML]] in Idris.
    - MLish: strict/CBV, D-H-M type inference / unification.
    - No modules (for now).
    - However with Haskellish syntax. Type applications. Function signatures.
    - Favour : as in Idris/Agda.
    - Use [[http://steshaw.org/hm/][Ian Grant's Hindly-Milner tutorial]].
    - [ ] Write articles on the different components.
      - Someone must stop folks from recommending "Let's write a compiler".
      - Movation/Inspiration:
        - Stephen Diehl's writing on his Haskell-like language.
        - [[http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2014-05-22-the-essence-of-compilation.html][The essence of Compilation]] by Tim Philip Williams.
        - [[http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2015-03-24-pcf.html][A Tiny Compiler For A Typed Higher Order Language]] by Danny Gratzer.
          - PCF to C
          - http://github.com/jozefg/pcf
  - [[#BabyIdris]]
  - Main outline
    - First there's a high-level language (probably interpreter or
      "bytecode" compiler". Basically the "front-end".
      - Type checking.
      - [Parametric] Polymorphism (aka generics).
      - Type inference. Probably HM/ML sweet spot.
    - Second, there's the compiler to native machine code with
      Instruction Selection, Register Allocation, Flow control,
      calling conventions, first-class functions and closure conversion.
      Basically the back-end.
    - Thirdly, there's optimisations like inlining, constant folding,
      copy propagation etc. This should probably be 2nd.
    - Fourthly, there's runtime system considerations:
      - Garbage collection.
  - Another skeleton:
    - Introduction to language design with the BabyML.
    - Lexing/Parsing
    - Semantic Analysis (Type Checking)
    - Simple IL/IR generation
    - Backends
      - Simple IL interpreter/engine + runtime.
      - Compile to native x86 or x86-64 (or x86-64 in with 32 bit pointers).
      - "transpile" to JS.
      - "transpile" to C?
      - "transpile" to Java (pro'ly unnecessary).
      - Compile to JVM (pro'ly unnecessary).
      - Compile to CLR/CLI (pro'ly unnecessary).
  - [ ] Port MinCaml to Idris.
    - [[https://esumii.github.io/min-caml/index-e.html][Min-Caml (website)]] [[https://esumii.github.io/min-caml/paper.pdf][paper]]
    - Looks like a nice overview from the middle to backend.
    - Would like to see nanopass ideas applied here but using recursion schemes
      rather than schemey dynamic typing.
    - Also nice to add polymorphism in the front-end language if viable.
  - [[https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/teaching/b522/s03/][CSCI B522 Programming Language Foundations Amr Sabry (course)]]
    - MinML/NanoML semantics. Be nice to write it up in `org-mode`
      and/or $$\LaTex$$.
    - Also seems to have verifications/proofs in Twelf.

*** Demystify Debuggers

  - [ ] How to get a symbolic debugger? Note Poly/ML has one.

** Demystify Lexer Generators

   - Would like to be able to generate the lexer from an embedded
     description. Pretty sure that Manuel Chakravarty did work on this
     (I have a note somewhere's).
   - Let's have something like this in Idris (and all the cool PLs).
     At least a Lex like thing.
   - [[http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/P/hallgren.pdf][This]] lexer for Haskell embedded a lexer generator.
     - Looks like it was used in hssources (is that a Hackage
       project?)
     - Paper says that the regex generator was based on the
       presentation in Appel's Modern Compiler Implementation in ML. 

** Demystify Parser Generators

  - I like the approach of [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/BNFC-meta][BNFC-meta]]. It defines the grammar in the
    language (even if it's via TH). Let's have this in Idris (and the
    cool PLs). At least something like Happy.
  - I know there's supposed to be more general way to parse these days
    than LR and LALR but perhaps they are slow too (if not, embed
    those types of grammars instead!).

    #+begin_quote
    The book is intended as an introduction for undergraduates who do not have a
    background in Agda, or type theory, or even functional programming.  (Note
    that the book is not intended to be a reference on advanced features of
    Agda; that would be a great book for others on this list to write!)  The
    goal of VFPiA is an introduction, for beginners, to ideas in applied type
    theory using Agda.
