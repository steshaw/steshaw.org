    - Yes, apparently. See [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nad/publications/danielsson-parser-combinators.html][Total Parser Combinators (paper)]]. This

      interesting. An undergraduate Cambridge student may be taking
      this up (overhead on #idris). Edwin Brady suggested that a total
      parser combinator library in Idris would ideally make use of the
      partial evaluator (see [[https://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/icfp10.pdf][this paper]]).

	#+begin_quote
	**It's second-class vs first-class that matters**

	That's not quite right. You seem to be assuming that you can
	always statically monomorphise universal polymorphism, but
	that is only true if polymorphism is second-class (*). And in
	that case, it is just as true for existential polymorphism
	(e.g., some SML compilers "monomorphise" modules routinely).
	As soon as you have first-class polymorphism, though (e.g.,
	higher-ranked polymorphic types), you cannot do that anymore,
	neither for universal nor for existential
	polymorphism. Furthermore, as naasking pointed out, you can
	encode existentials with universals then, so there really is
	no difference in the degree of static knowledge.  In short,
	the compile time vs run time distinction does not hinge on
	universal vs existential polymorphism, but on second-class vs
	first-class polymorphism (and existentials in Haskell happen
	to be first-class).  (*) And in fact, not even then, as
	Haskell's counter-example of polymorphic recursion shows --
	contrary to popular belief, type class polymorphism is not
	static in Haskell, not even in plain H'98. Common
	optimisations notwithstanding.

*** Modules and Dependently Typed Languages
  - Agda/Coq/Cayenne
  - [[http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/images/5/5e/Cayenne.pdf][Cayenne - a language with dependent types]]
  - Can dependent records do (like in Cayenne)?
    - surely dependended records don't help with separate compilation.
  - Agda seems to have a simple module system. See [[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/talks/modules-061220.pdf][these slides]].
    #+begin_quote
    You don’t need a fancy module system ... and you tell me why I’m wrong.

  - strict/cbv (with at least optional call-by-name) v non-strict/lazy/cb-need
  - with stream transducers, generators (Simple Generators), pipes, conduits, machines, iteratees, Clojures's transducers/reducers etc for stream processing. These work well with strict languages.

** Demystify Advanced Functional Programming
  - recursion schemes
  - Algebra of Programming.
  - notes/slides/articles/courseware

** Demystify Compilers
  - Develop (literate) code, articles, slides, notes, articles.
  - Writing/blog series on BabyML / BabyIdris:
    - Let noone ever recommend "Let's write a compiler" ever again.
    - Stephen Diehl is doing a very nice job for a Haskell-like
      language so let's stick with CBV and move into DTs.
    - "The essense of compilation" compiling a simple language in the
      smallest possible compiler ([[http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2014-05-22-the-essence-of-compilation.html][inspiration]]). More than Hutton's Razor!
    - http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2015-03-24-pcf.html
    - There seem to be a few Min/Mini-ML/NanoML and NanoAgda's about.
    - Also Simply Easy / Simply Easier / PiSigma and pi-forall.
  - Main outline
    - First there's a high-level language (probably interpreter or
      "bytecode" compiler". Basically the "front-end".
      - Type checking.
      - [Parametric] Polymorphism (aka generics).
      - Type inference. Probably HM/ML sweet spot.
    - Second, there's the compiler to native machine code with
      Instruction Selection, Register Allocation, Flow control,
      calling conventions, first-class functions and closure conversion.
      Basically the back-end.
    - Thirdly, there's optimisations like inlining, constant folding,
      copy propagation etc. This should probably be 2nd.
    - Fourthly, there's runtime system considerations:
      - Garbage collection.
  - Another skeleton:
    - Introduction to language design with the BabyML.
    - Lexing/Parsing
    - Semantic Analysis (Type Checking)
    - Simple IL/IR generation
    - Backends
      - Simple IL interpreter/engine + runtime.
      - Compile to native x86 or x86-64 (or x86-64 in with 32 bit pointers).
      - "transpile" to JS.
      - "transpile" to C?
      - "transpile" to Java (pro'ly unnecessary).
      - Compile to JVM (pro'ly unnecessary).
      - Compile to CLR/CLI (pro'ly unnecessary).
  - MinCaml looks great particularly for the middle to backend. Would
    be nice to have polymorphism (i.e. nicer PL) in the front-end though.
  - [[https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/teaching/b522/s03/][CSCI B522 Programming Language Foundations Amr Sabry (course)]]
    - MinML/NanoML semantics. Be nice to write it up in `org-mode`
      and/or $$\LaTex$$.
    - Also seems to have verifications/proofs in Twelf.

** Demystify Lexer Generators

   - Would like to be able to generate the lexer from an embedded
     description. Pretty sure that Manuel Chakravarty did work on this
     (I have a note somewhere's).
   - Let's have something like this in Idris (and all the cool PLs).
     At least a Lex like thing.
   - [[http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/P/hallgren.pdf][This]] lexer for Haskell embedded a lexer generator.
     - Looks like it was used in hssources (is that a Hackage
       project?)
     - Paper says that the regex generator was based on the
       presentation in Appel's Modern Compiler Implementation in ML. 

** Demystify Parser Generators

  - I like the approach of [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/BNFC-meta][BNFC-meta]]. It defines the grammar in the
    language (even if it's via TH). Let's have this in Idris (and the
    cool PLs). At least something like Happy.
  - I know there's supposed to be more general way to parse these days
    than LR and LALR but perhaps they are slow too (if not, embed
    those types of grammars instead!).
  - [[https://github.com/ollef/Earley/][Early]] an embedded Early (context-free) parser combinator library
    in Haskell.
  - Haskell style "layout rule". PKA Landin's offside rule.

*** Learn LaTex

 - Produce something (tech report?) with LaTeX. Perhaps via org-mode.
** Haskell

- Can it be proven that total languages can safely use fusion (because 
  they can evaluated non-strictly)?

*** Swift parser for Haskell

  - sigh, language-swift-quote is stalled because of ambiguities in
    the grammar

*** Turtle

  - Convert the [[http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html][horrors of Bash]] to the wonders of Turtle Haskell

*** Web frameworks in Haskell.
   - Try out Scotty, Spock, Yesod, Snap, Servant.
     - http://www.yesodweb.com/book/yesod-for-haskellers
   - Write a REST/JSON client in Haskell (Twitter/GitHub client, say).
