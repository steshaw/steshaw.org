* Error messages

  - Pretty bad error messages. Let's try to list some:
  - This happened when I tried to import Data.Nat which does not exist. However, it doesn't say in which file!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
$ make
idris --build calc.ipkg
Entering directory `./src'
Can't find import Data/Nat
make: *** [build] Error 1
#+END_QUOTE
  
- Could do 'implementation Layout String' in calc.idr because it was defined in Lightyear.Strings (but I wasn't importing that and Idris was asking for an implementation).


* Other

- Expected to have an (>>) operator. Wasn't there...
