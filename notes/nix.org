# Notes from NixOS-IFIP

Nix

package management system (or simply a package system or packager)

Describes programs (typical packages) but also configuration and services.


- multiple variants of a package at the same time (side by side)

- incomplete dependency specification (version ranges only)
  steshaw: Ok -- cool. What's wrong with version ranges and how do we fix it?

steshaw: I want configuration to _be_ a package. I hope this works with Nix.
