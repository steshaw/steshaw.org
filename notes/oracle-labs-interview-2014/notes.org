* Representing Graphs + transitive closure of directed graph:

- Use matrix representation!
- Could encode using a sparse matrix.
- Fix point of multiplying the matrix by itself.
- Make efficient using:
  - Warshall's Algorithm transitive closure. O(n³)
  - Coppersmith and Winograd - faster transitive closure n²·³
