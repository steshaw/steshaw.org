* Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory

- proof != formal proof

- The principle of the conservation of truth!
  - you cannot get out more than you put in


- implication with a horseshoe
  - look like a reverse subset symbol (i.e. superset)
  - \alpha \rightarrow \beta is instead written, \alpha âŠƒ \beta
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_(symbol)
  - reason that superset is implication to be explained in a later lecture.
