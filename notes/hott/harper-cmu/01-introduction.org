* Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory

#+begin_quote
Althought it's called Homotopy Type Theory because it's motiviations
come from Homotopy Theory... It really is a self-standing subject
that's not tied to Algebraic Topology. What is really is, is a
somewhat sophiticated analysis of the concept of equality in
constructive type theory.

** Type Theories --- 40 years of type theory.

- Intuionistic Type Theory (TT) by Per Martin-Löf.
  - Analysis and expansion of Brouwer's program of intuitionism.
- Intentional Type Theory (ITT).
  - starting point (for HoTT?)
- Extensional Type Theory (ETT).
  - ITT \equiv ER + UIP
    - ER :: equality reflection
    - UIP :: uniqueness of identity proofs
  - The intuitionistic theory of sets.
    - inspired strongly by the work of Bishop
  - NuPRL is a kind of "Constructive Set Theory".
- HoTT
  - HoTT \equiv ITT + HIT + UA
    - ITT :: Intuitionistic Type Theory
    - HIT :: Higher Inductive Types
    - UA :: Univalence Axiom
  - Intuitionistic Theory of weak infinity groupoids


** Highlights

- proof != formal proof

- The principle of the conservation of truth!
  - you cannot get out more than you put in

- implication with a horseshoe
  - look like a reverse subset symbol (i.e. superset)
  - \alpha \rightarrow \beta is instead written, \alpha ⊃ \beta
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_(symbol)
  - reason that superset is implication to be explained in a later
    lecture.
