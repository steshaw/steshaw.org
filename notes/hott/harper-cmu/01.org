* Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory

#+begin_quote
Althought it's called Homotopy Type Theory because it's motiviations
come from Homotopy Theory... It really is a self-standing subject
that's not tied to Algebraic Topology. What is really is, is a
somewhat sophiticated analysis of the concept of equality in
constructive type theory.

- proof != formal proof

- The principle of the conservation of truth!
  - you cannot get out more than you put in


- implication with a horseshoe
  - look like a reverse subset symbol (i.e. superset)
  - \alpha \rightarrow \beta is instead written, \alpha âŠƒ \beta
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_(symbol)
  - reason that superset is implication to be explained in a later lecture.
