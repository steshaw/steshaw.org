    - _exhaustiveness_ — Does a match cover all cases?
    - _redundancy_ — Do all equations have accessible RHSs?
    - _laziness_ — How does left-to-right evaluation order affect the above?
    - More exotic features like view-patterns and pattern-synonyms.

### Dependent pattern-matching

What about pattern-matching for dependently-typed functional languages?

How well does Idris produce warnings for redundancy and exhaustiveness?
In the face of guards? View patterns? Pattern synonyms?

[What _is_ axiom K](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39239363/what-is-axiom-k/39256457) and why would you want to avoid it?
