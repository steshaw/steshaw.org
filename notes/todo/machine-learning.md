# Machine Learning

Perhaps a nicer name for AI (artificial intelligence) but likely to be a
technical subset. Probably also known as data science.

## Books

Not sure how these "oldies but goodies" apply to modern Machine Learning but
they still are on my bucket list anyhow (though I read much of PAIP).

- Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp,
  by Peter Norvig. Still on my bookshelf! Needs reopening :).
- Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, (Third edition) by Stuart Russell 
  and Peter Norvig.
