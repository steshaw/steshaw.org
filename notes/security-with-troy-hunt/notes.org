* Security Day with Troy Hunt


- Chome Developer Tools
  - View source
  - Inspect elements
  - Network - request and response headers
  - Cookies
    - Auth cookies needs to be cryptographically strong.

- Errors
  - Not handling quotes.
  - Changing urls.


** Hacker Challenge 1
  - short passwords allowed (cannot use a long password? 32 characters)
  - Remember me stores emails and password as non-secure cookies. Password was actually b64 encoded!
  - Session and Auth cookies are not secure.
  - XXX AuthCookie not HTTP only.
  - Can login over HTTP rather than HTTPS.
  - XXX Password was sent over email!

- Cannot load login/payment forms over HTTP (because man in the middle changes to page/form).

- HSTS narrows the window. Browser knows that requests must be over HTTPS.

- haveibeenpwned.com

- Think about cookie expiry.
  - discussion about usability v security (e.g. facebook.com vs commbank.com.au)

- Need brute force password attempt protection.

** Hacker Challenge 2. Multiple votes.
  - Repeat the POST request to the /api/vote.


** Reflected cross site scripting (XSS)

- Top 10 Risks from OWASP.

- Script injection from untrusted user data.
  - query parameters.
  - request body
  - request headers


** Hacker Challenge 3

- HTTP only cookies.
- Secure only cookies.
- over HTTPS

- "Defence in depth"


** Exercise 4: SQL injection (SQLi)

- inject "select cast(@@version as int)" into order by ${x}

- principle of least priviledge on the db account. (not a super user)

- Only real way to validate an email address is to send 'em an email and have 'em confirm it.

- sqlmap.org â€” tool to automate SQL injection.

- OWASP top 10 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10


** Mobile APIs (and IoT - Internet of Things)

- Cert pinning?


- Look at the HTTP requests for sensitive data.

** Exercise 5 - Mobile APIs

- Proxy your device
  - Inspect the traffic of your apps
  - Perform normal activities and monitor requests.


** CSRF/XSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
  - anti forgery token


** Hacker Challenge 6


** Exercise 7 - Framework disclosure


- www.shodanhq.com

- http://www.pluralsight.com/author/troy-hunt

- Pwned! Owned


- Exercise 7 - Framework disclosure
  - "extensions" in urls e.g. .asp, .aspx, .php, .jsp, .do.
  - standard names of cookies like JSESSIONID, PHPSESSID.
  - meta "generator" tag like for Wordpress.
  - Server: response header, Apache, Jetty. + X- headers like X-AspNet-Version.
  - Cache busting techniques like hash on the end of img src urls (Rails).
  - Element ids for JSF apps usually like "j_*"
  - Cookie names and Names of hidden form elements used for anti forgery token.
    e.g. __RequestVerificationToken

- Fingerprinting.
  - Order that the response components are served.

- Firefox addon Wappleier (what tech are they using).
