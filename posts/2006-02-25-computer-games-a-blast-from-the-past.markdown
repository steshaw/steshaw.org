I've been watching more video and listening to more audio (podcasts) lately on my computer. One way to do this is searching via Google. This is one of the videos I found - ["Now and Then: Computer Graphics in Games"](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-422890025950694425&q=Computer+History+Museum). Makers of Myst, Prince of Perisa and The Sims talk about their games and discuss issues of games developement. Really very interesting stuff.
