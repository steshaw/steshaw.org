Work can be a drag if you find yourself in a den of assholes.
Unfortunately, this is becoming more and more common in our
narcissist-generating society. I'd like to start a conversation about
how we might tackle this problem. Here's an outline of how we might
begin to approach the problem.

TL/DR: start with Robert Sutton's /No Asshole Rule/ and follow that 
up with modelling your behaviour on a gentleman (that's where the
/Cambridge Culture/ comes in).

** The No Asshole Rule

There are a lot of assholes out there. I've run into a few more than my
fair share — it seems to be par for the course when you're a contract
programmer (I gave up that gig a few years ago but I still have the war
stories). Assholes make people feel oppressed, humiliated, de-energised
and belittled. In short, they destroy rather than create. The targets of
their behaviour tend to be those less powerful — so assholes in
management have a larger area of destruction.

These assholes can poison your whole organisation, leading to a culture
of fear, lower productivity, high staff turnover, general unhappiness
and gnashing of teeth.

The assholes tend to think that their behaviour is justified because it
helps to “get the job done”. However, Sutton points out this is a kind
of confirmation bias and usually “stuff gets done” despite the behaviour
of the asshole — not /because/ of it.

The best method of dealing with assholes is avoidance. Don't take on a
job, contract or customer if you're going to have to live with assholes.
If you find yourself in a den of assholes besides your best efforts then
leave as soon as you can manage it. Sutton recommends /indifference/ for
putting up with assholes but that's not for me — I find it very
difficult to be indifferent. He also recommends /reframing/ and /small
wins/ which seem better coping mechanisms to me. You may find you need
to take a break after suffering at the wrong end of an asshole.

Don't confuse the /occasional/ asshole with the /institutional/ one
(Sutton calls this the /temporary asshole/ and the /certified asshole/).
Everyone blows up occasionally and let's their “inner asshole”
out — particularly when under the thumb of an institutional asshole!
Don't be too quick to label the strange or unusual as
assholes — Sutton has a book on this topic:
[[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7923731.Wierd_Ideas_that_Work][Weird
Ideas that Work]]. A good tip for preventing the inner-asshole from
escaping is: /argue like you're right, listen like you're wrong./

I don't believe that assholes are virtuous despite Sutton's reluctant
chapter on it. One thing that makes sense is that being an asshole may
be a short-cut to power and status — that is if the weaklings around
them let them get away with it ☺. Who doesn't know one or two loud
mouth, arrogant, self-professed experts that go on a power-grab and
succeed because few resisted? Don't let it happen in your
organisation — unless you're leaving to join or /be/ the
competition ;). If you have to put up with the odd asshole from time to
time, whatever you do, do /not/ promote them. Keep them in a box, try to
reform them (possible if they are only an /occasional/ asshole, unlikely
if they are a /certified/ asshole). If that doesn't work out, fire them.

Remember: /a few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch./

** A Cambridge Culture

A partial remedy to this situation is to adopt what I like to call a
/Cambridge Culture/. This is as simple as modelling yourself on the
behaviour of Simon Peyton Jones. Simon is the lead engineer of the
Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler (aka GHC). He works at Microsoft
Research in Cambridge (hence the name).

If you don't know Simon, he can be described as a scholar and a gent.
While being someone who is very bright, accomplished and energetic;
Simon doesn't feel entitled to indulge in behaviour that could be
perceived as arrogant, haughty, overbearing, dictatorial etc. Simon also
accepts that there are other intelligent folks who might have views that
run somewhat counter to his own. In this situation, he is not only
tolerant but patiently teaches if those folks are open to it. He also
listens carefully to work out where he may be off-track himself (if not
completely wrong). As lead of GHC, Simon encourages participation and
rarely feels the need to choose an option (from say a bunch of competing
but equally decent candidates), instead allowing the community to reach
a consensus where possible but breaking deadlocks where necessary. He
shys away from the title /Benevolent Dictator for Life/ (BDFL). Simon is
definitely not a hater.

Don't be a hater. If you have to hate anyone, hate the haters :P. You
know... don't even hate the haters:
