My current client is running our project as a heavy RUP process :( . Big
design up front with Rose UML diagrams, tedious and restrictive coding
standard, manual code review Word documents and ClearCase LT 2003 with
mandatory reserved locking. I find myself
Googling Agile and Scrum much more often lately :) . It's even got me
thinking that I should take the Certified Scrum Master training (or at least
attend a [free talk coming up at
SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/scrum-in-the-brain-session-03-2007)).

A quick start article I found is called [Begin Using
Scrum](http://www.controlchaos.com/old-site/implem.htm)...

I'm also a little concerned that Scrum Alliance are too inflexible after
reading ["When is Scrum not
Scrum?"](http://agilethinking.net/blog/2007/02/21/when-is-scrum-not-scrum/).
So perhaps formal training is not the way to go...
