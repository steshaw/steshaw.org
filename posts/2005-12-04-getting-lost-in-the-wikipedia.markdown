More and more lately, I've noticed myself reading the Wikipedia. It appears
prominently in many of my Google searches. I've heard it critized because
the content is not reviewed (some guy was bent out of shape about a comment
about him being involved with the assasination of JFK - rightly so). Anyhow,
I've only found the information excellent.

Get lost in the Wikipedia - some starting points:
[x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86),
[UNCOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCOL).
