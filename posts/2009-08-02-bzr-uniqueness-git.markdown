The unique thing about Bazaar, compared with say Mercurial, seems to be that
the community has developed tools for [some typical
workflows](http://bazaar-vcs.org/Workflows).

I'm still using Mercurial for my personal files at home. Since I use Linux
as my primary development platform, Git is getting the upper hand for me.
I'll have to give hg2git a try. This will allow me the opportunity to prune
my Photos directory. The git-svn support is useful when clients are using
Subversion, and you want to work from your laptop. Also,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is pretty cool. I've [only played around with
it](http://github.com/steshaw/) a little. It has paid accounts that can be
used for private development. Private accounts could also be useful for
off-site backup of sources. Git works well on Mac, but last I
heard the support on Windows is still lacking. Git works in Cygwin with a
native port on the way. I haven't used Windows for development for a while
but always used to install Cygwin when I did. However, that's not
necessarily a convenient solution for regular Windows/.NET guys. If I was doing a
.NET project, I'd probably stick with Subversion - git-svn is always there
for disconnected development.

I wonder if there are Bazaar style workflow solutions for Git...
