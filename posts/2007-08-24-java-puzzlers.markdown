Go directly to [here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9214177555401838409) if you think you know all the dark corners of the Java language and APIs. It's a really worthwhile Google TechTalk. You will come away thinking that you had better set up automated [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) analysis of your code!
