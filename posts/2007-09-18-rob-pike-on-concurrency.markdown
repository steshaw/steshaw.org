Watch this [great Google talk with Rob
Pike](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=810232012617965344). He talks
about concurrent processes and message passing in the context of Newsqueak -
a programming language that he wrote 20 years ago. What he describes is very
similar to the Erlang programming model except that channels are first class
citizens.
