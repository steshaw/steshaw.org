I would really like to try a Mac as my next computer. I've been meaning to ever since they went UNIX :D . Haven't decided yet between a MacBook, MacBook Pro or iMac. However, I keep coming back to the pricing ... particularly here the UK and I hear it's the same throughout Europe.

A basic spec 15" MacBook Pro is £1,300 in the UK and only $2,000 in the US...
Almost 600USD more expensive :(

The standard iMac 24" is £1,350 in the UK and only $2,000 in the US...
Almost 700USD more expensive :(

Where does the MacTax go?
