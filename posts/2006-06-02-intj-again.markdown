Just took this free [Online Myer-Brigg personality type test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp) and I came out as INTJ again. I fiddled with some of the questions that could go either way but ...still INTJ. Here are the results:



<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" border="1" ><tbody ><tr >
<td ><table ><tbody ><tr align="center" >
<td >
Your Type is ** INTJ**
</td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="50%" ><tbody ><tr align="center" >
<td >Introverted

<td >Intuitive

<td >Thinking

</tr>

Qualitative analysis of your type formula
You are:

  * very expressed introvert

  * distinctively expressed intuitive personality

  * slightly expressed thinking personality

  * moderately expressed judging personality

It seems to think that I don't think! I assure you that I *do* think :-). Really!
