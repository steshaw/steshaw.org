I've been wanting to give Spacemacs another try for Haskell development.
In particular, I wanted it to work with =intero= and =hindent=.


** Install Emacs

I like to use Mitsuharu Yamamoto's emacs-mac, rather than Aquamacs or
emacsformacosx.

#+begin_src shell
$ brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
$ brew cask install emacs-mac
#+end_src


** Install Dependencies

The haskell layer in Spacemacs requires a few dependencies. I installed them
with Stack.

#+begin_src shell
$ stack install hlint hasktags hoogle ghc-mod intero
$ stack --resolver nightly-2017-08-12 install apply-refact
#+end_src


** Haskell layer

I added the =haskell= layer plus =autocompletion= which it seems to require.
I also followed the documentation in configuring intero and hindent (though
the style "johan-tibell" no longer seems required as hindent no longer
supports multiple styles).

After adding a few other layers, my configuration layers in =~/.spacemacs=
looked like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     ansible
     auto-completion
     emacs-lisp
     git
     (haskell :variables
              haskell-completion-backend 'intero
              haskell-enable-hindent-style "johan-tibell")
     helm
     html
     javascript
     markdown
     org
     osx
     (shell :variables
            shell-default-height 30
            shell-default-position 'bottom)
     spell-checking
     syntax-checking
     themes-megapack
     version-control
     yaml
     )
#+end_src

** Project sidebar

I missed having a project sidebar (such as seems to be the default in 
editors like Atom). Eventually I found that Spacemacs includes NeoTree
which makes a viable project sidebar. Toggle on/off with =SPC p t= or
=SPC f t= for a file rather than project browser.

[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#neotree-file-tree][See more in the documentation]]

** Tab bar

I also missed having a tab bar (for open files) such as that in Atom.
There doesn't seem to be anything built into Spacemacs for this. I
tried the [[https://github.com/evacchi/tabbar-layer][tabbar-layer]] but it was pretty ugly.

After some searching, I figured I could rely on "helm-mini". It lets you open
search/select files from the open buffers (=SPC b b=). Also searching/selecting
for files in the same project is possible from projectile (=SPC p f=).


** Fill column indicator

I wanted my little indicator for the 80th column.
Here, you need to tweak your =~/.spacemacs= file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (spacemacs/toggle-fill-column-indicator-on)
  )
#+end_src

** Theme

It was fun seeing the different themes available for Spacemacs. It's best to
install =themes-megapack= layer (see my layers configuration above). I don't
mind the default =spacemacs-dark= theme but here are some of my other favourites:

- =deeper-blue=
- =dracula=
- =sanityinc-solarized-dark=
- =solarized-dark=

Check out [[http://themegallery.robdor.com/][the gallery]].

I finally settled on =deeper-blue=.
