Just watched an [intro to Guice video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6068447410873108038&q=user%3A%22Google+engEDU) from Google. Looks pretty interesting. Be nice to have less Spring beans configuration files :).

[Lots of other interesting Google talks](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=user%3A%22Google+engEDU%22&so=1) are available!
