I've read the original [Worse Is Better](http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html) article by Richard Gabriel a couple of times now. I discovered it via my interest in programming languages (Lisp in this case).

Jim Waldo reminds us that Better really is *better* in Artima article [Worse is worse](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=24807).
