Just watched Ted Neward's [TSS tech
talk](http://www.theserverside.com/talks/videos/TedNeward/interview.tss?bandwidth=dsl).
It resonated with me quite well. He revealed that his new book - Effective
Enterprise Java - is sumed up by the phrase: "Avoid round trips!". I like
his "let's not get religious about OO" attitude. He seems a little closed to
dynamically typed languages and talks about "strong typing" when he means
"static typing". Anyways, he's trying out Smalltalk so there's hope :). All
the talk of REST and "spaces" (JavaSpaces, T-Spaces etc) leads me to think
of the Erlang and Oz models of concurrency (like a generalisation of the
UNIX pipe). These languages need more proponents!
