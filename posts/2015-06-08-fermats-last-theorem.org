Fermat's Last Theorem is a wonderful, inspiring documentary. It's the story
of a simple mathematical problem that went unsolved for centuries. It starts
with /Pythagoras' theorem/,

#+begin_eqtion
  x^2 + y^2 = z^2
#+end_eqtion

What are the whole number solutions of this equation?

#+begin_eqtion
  3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 \\
  5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 \\
  ...
#+end_eqtion

Fermat wondered if this could be extended to the following equations:

#+begin_eqtion
  x^3 + y^3 = z^3 \\
  x^4 + y^4 = z^4 \\
  ... \\
  x^n + y^n = z^n
#+end_eqtion

Fermat could find no whole number solutions to this more general equation.
Fermat's conjecture was that:

#+begin_eqtion
  There are no whole number solutions were n > 2.
#+end_eqtion

It was 1637 when Fermat made the marginal note in Arithmetica—a book he was
reading at the time—stating his conjecture and mentioning that he had a proof
that would not "fit in the margin". It's this conjecture that became known as
/Fermat's Last Theorem/. The proof lay undiscovered for centuries!

In 1963, a 10 year old boy came across a book in the local library about
Fermat's Last Theorem. He instantly became obsessed with this wonderfully
simple problem—a problem simple enough for a 10 year old to understand! This
boy was Andrew Wiles. Andrew was so taken with the problem that he eventually
became a professor of mathematics. After giving up on the problem for some
time, he eventually saw his opportunity as some of the pieces moved into
place. He then worked on the problem full-time for /7 years/. For the first 2
years, he merely explored the problem, not knowing where to begin. Finally,
he cracked it! However, there's a gut wrenching twist to the story that means
that the proof takes another year to nail down. I won't spoil that here.
