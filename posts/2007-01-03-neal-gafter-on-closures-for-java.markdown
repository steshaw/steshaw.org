A [interesting talk by Neal Gafter](http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Closures+for+Java). Neal explains some of the problems with using anonymous inner classes and how closures will address those. With closures for Java being sold to developers it seems like they are much closer to being added to the official language specification. Yippie!

Seems [from Neal's resume](http://www.gafter.com/~neal/resume.html) that closures are indeed "proposed for inclusion in JDK7" :)
