The [interview with Cameron Purdy at
TSS](http://www.theserverside.com/talks/video.tss?id=CameronPurdy&format=http)
was a good read. Afew years back I was very interested in object databases
and then [distributed] transactional caches. A coworker at ADC (now Intec)
from the research lab put me onto the [work of Stephen
Blackburn](http://ali-www.cs.umass.edu/~steveb/pubs/abstracts.html#thesis).
