<p>Yet the ardor for inflation never dies. It would almost
seem as if no country is capable of profiting from the
experience of another and no generation of learning from the
sufferings of its forebears. Each generation and country
follows the same mirage. Each grasps for the same Dead Sea
fruit that turns to dust and ashes in its mouth. For it is the
nature of inflation to give birth to a thousand illusions.</p>

<p>In our own day the most persistent argument put forward for
inflation is that it will “get the wheels of industry
turning,” that it will save us from the irretrievable losses
of stagnation and idleness and bring “full employment.”
This argument in its cruder form rests on the immemorial
confusion between money and real wealth. It assumes that new
“purchasing power” is being brought into existence, and
that the effects of this new purchasing power multiply
themselves in ever-widening circles, like the ripples caused
by a stone thrown into a pond. The real purchasing power for
goods, however, as we have seen, consists of other goods. It
cannot be wondrously increased merely by printing more pieces
of paper called dollars. Fundamentally what happens in an
exchange economy is that the things that A produces are
exchanged for the things that B produces. <A

<p>What inflation really does is to change the relationships
of prices and costs. The most important change it is designed
to bring about is to raise commodity prices in relation to
wage rates, and so to restore business profits, and encourage
a resumption of output at the points where idle resources
exist, by restoring a workable relationship between prices and
costs of production.</p>

<p>It should be immediately clear that this could be brought
about more directly and honestly by a reduction in unworkable
wage rates. But the more sophisticated proponents of inflation
believe that this is now politically impossible. Sometimes
they go further, and charge that all proposals under any
circumstances to reduce particular wage rates directly in
order to reduce unemployment are “antilabor.” But what
they are themselves proposing, stated in bald terms, is to
<i>deceive </i>labor by reducing <i>real </i>wage rates (that
is, wage rates in terms of purchasing power) through an
increase in prices.</p>

<p>What they forget is that labor has itself become
sophisticated; that the big unions employ labor economists who
know about index numbers, and that labor is not deceived. The
policy, therefore, under present conditions, seems unlikely to
accomplish either its economic or its political aims. For it
is precisely the most powerful unions, whose wage rates are
most likely to be in need of correction, that will insist that
their wage rates be raised at least in proportion to any
increase in the cost-of-living index. The unworkable
relationships between prices and key wage rates, if the
insistence of the powerful unions prevails, will remain. The
wage rate structure, in fact, may become even more distorted;
for the great mass of unorganized workers, whose wage rates
even before the inflation were not out of line (and may even
have been unduly depressed through union exclusionism), will
be penalized further during the transition by the rise in
prices.</p>
