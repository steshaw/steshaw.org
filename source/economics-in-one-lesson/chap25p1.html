<p><span class="intro">Economics,</span>, as we have now seen
again and again, is a science of recognizing <i>secondary</i>
consequences. It is also a science of seeing <i>general
</i>consequences. It is the science of tracing the effects of
some proposed or existing policy not only on some <i>special
</i>interest <i>in the short run, </i>but on the <i>general
</i>interest <i>in the long run.</i></p>

<p>This is the lesson that has been the special concern of
this book. We stated it first in skeleton form, and then put
flesh and skin on it through more than a score of practical
applications.</p>

<p>But in the course of specific illustration we have found
hints of other general lessons; and we should do well to state
these lessons to ourselves more clearly.</p>

<p>In seeing that economics is a science of tracing
consequences, we must have become aware that, like logic and
mathematics, it is a science of recognizing inevitable
implications.</p>

<p>We may illustrate this by an elementary equation in
algebra. Suppose we say that if x = then x + y = 12. The
“solution” to this equation is that y equals 7; but this
is so precisely because the calculation <i>tells </i>us in
effect that)? equals 7. It does not make that assertion
directly, but it inevitably implies it.</p>

<p>What is true of this elementary equation is true of the
most complicated and abstruse equations encountered in
mathematics. <i>The answer already lies in the statement of
the problem. </i>It must, it is true, be “worked out.” The
result, it is true, may sometimes come to the man who works
out the equation as a stunning surprise. He may even have a
sense of discovering something entirely new—a thrill like
that of “some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims
into his ken.” His sense of discovery may be justified by
the theoretical or practical consequences of his answer. Yet
the answer was already contained in the formulation of the
problem. It was merely not recognized at once. For mathematics
reminds us that inevitable implications are not necessarily
obvious implications.</p>

<p>All this is equally true of economics. In this respect
economics might be compared also to engineering. When an
engineer has a problem, he must first determine all the facts
bearing on that problem. If he designs a bridge to span two
points, he must first know the exact distance between these
two points, their precise topographical nature, the maximum
load his bridge will be designed to carry, the tensile and
compressive strength of the steel or other material of which
the bridge is to be built, and the stresses and strains to
which it may be subjected. Much of this factual research has
already been done for him by others. His predecessors, also,
have already evolved elaborate mathematical equations by
which, knowing the strength of his materials and the stresses
to which they will be subjected, he can determine the
necessary diameter, shape, number and structure of his towers,
cables and girders.</p>

<p>In the same way the economist, assigned a practical
problem, must know both the essential facts of that problem
and the valid deductions to be drawn from those facts. The
deductive side of economics is no less important than the
factual. One can say of it what Santayana says of logic (and
what could be equally well said of mathematics), that it
“traces the radiation of truth,” so that “when one term
of a logical system is known to describe a fact, the whole
system attaching to that term becomes, as it were,
incandescent.”<A href="#*"><sup>[*]</sup></a></p>

<p>Now few people recognize the necessary implications of the
economic statements they are constantly making. When they say
that the way to economic salvation is to increase credit, it
is just as if they said that the way to economic salvation is
to increase debt: these are different names for the same thing
seen from opposite sides. When they say that the way to
prosperity is to increase farm prices, it is like saying that
the way to prosperity is to make food dearer for the city
worker. When they say that the way to national wealth is to
pay out governmental subsidies, they are in effect saying that
the way to national wealth is to increase taxes. When they
make it a main objective to increase exports, most of them do
not realize that they necessarily make it a main objective
ultimately to increase imports. When they say, under nearly
all conditions, that the way to recovery is to increase wage
rates, they have found only another way of saying that the way
to recovery is to increase costs of production.</p>

<p>It does not necessarily follow, because each of these
propositions, like a coin, has its reverse side, or because
the equivalent proposition, or the other name for the remedy,
sounds much less attractive, that the original proposal is
under all conditions unsound. There may be times when an
increase in debt is a minor consideration as against the gains
achieved with the borrowed funds; when a government subsidy is
unavoidable to achieve a certain military purpose; when a
given industry can afford an increase in production costs, and
so on. But we ought to make sure in each case that both sides
of the coin have been considered, that all the implications of
a proposal have been studied. And this is seldom done.</p>
