<p><span class="intro">The indignation shown</span> by many
people today at the mention of the very word <i>profits
</i>indicates how little understanding there is of the vital
function that profits play in our economy. To increase our
understanding, we shall go over again some of the ground
already covered in chapter fifteen on the price system, but we
shall view the subject from a different angle.</p>

<p>Profits actually do not bulk large in our total economy.
The net income of incorporated business in the fifteen years
from 1929 to 1943, to take some illustrative figures, averaged
less than percent of the total national income. Corporate
profits after taxes in the five years from 1956 to 1960
averaged less than 6 percent of the national income. Corporate
profits after taxes in the five years 1971 through 1977 also
averaged less than 6 percent of the national income (in spite
of the fact that, as a result of insufficient accounting
adjustment for inflation, they were probably overstated).<A
href="chap28p1.html#10PM"><sup>10</sup></A> Yet profits are
the form of income toward which there is most hostility. It is
significant that while there is a word <i>profiteer </i>to
stigmatize those who make allegedly excessive profits, there
is no such word as “wageer”—or “losseer.” Yet the
profits of the owner of a barbershop may average much less not
merely than the salary of a motion picture star or the hired
head of a steel corporation, but less even than the average
wage for skilled labor.</p>

<p>The subject is clouded by all sorts of factual
misconceptions. The total profits of General Motors, the
greatest industrial corporation in the world, are taken as if
they were typical rather than exceptional. Few people are
acquainted with the mortality rates for business concerns.
They do not know (to quote from the TNEC studies) that
“should conditions of business averaging the experience of
the last fifty years prevail, about seven of each ten grocery
stores opening today will survive into their second year; only
four of the ten may expect to celebrate their fourth
birthday.” They do not know that in every year from 1930 to
1938, in the income tax statistics, the number of corporations
that showed a loss exceeded the number that showed a
profit.</p>

<p>How much do profits, on the average, amount to?</p>

<p>This question is commonly answered by citing the kind of
figures I presented at the beginning of this chapter—that
corporate profits average less than 6 percent of the national
income — or by pointing out that the average profits after
income taxes of all manufacturing corporations are less than
five cents per dollar of sales. (For the five years 1971
through 1975, for example, the figure was only 4.6 cents.) <A
href="chap28p1.html#11PM"><sup>[11]</sup></a> But these
official figures, though they fall far below popular notions
of the size of profits, apply only to corporation results,
calculated by conventional methods of accounting. No
trustworthy estimate has been made that takes into account all
kinds of activity, unincorporated as well as incorporated
business, and a sufficient number of good and bad years. But
some eminent economists believe that over a long period of
years, after allowance is made for all losses, for a minimum
“riskless” interest on invested capital, and for an
imputed “reasonable” wage value of the services of people
who run their own business, no net profit at all may be left
over, and that there may even be a net loss. This is not at
all because entrepreneurs (people who go into business for
themselves) are intentional philanthropists, but because their
optimism and self-confidence too often lead them into <A
href="#*">ventures that do not or cannot succeed)
<sup>[*]</sup></a></p>

<p>It is clear, in any case, that any individual placing
venture capital runs a risk not only of earning no return but
of losing his whole principal. In the past it has been the
lure of high profits in special firms or industries that has
led him to take that great risk. But if profits are limited to
a maximum of, say, 10 percent or some similar figure, while
the risk of losing one’s entire capital still exists, what
is likely to be the effect on the profit incentive, and hence
on employment and production? The World War II excess-profits
tax showed what such a limit can do, even for a short period,
in undermining efficiency.</p>

<p>Yet governmental policy almost everywhere today tends to
assume that production will go on automatically, no matter
what is done to discourage it. One of the greatest dangers to
world production today still comes from government
price-fixing policies. Not only do these policies put one item
after another out of production by leaving no incentive to
make it, but their long-run effect is to prevent a balance of
production in accordance with the actual demands of consumers.
When the economy is free, demand so acts that some branches of
production make what some government officials regard as
“excessive,” “unreasonable,” or even “obscene”
profits. But that very fact not only causes every firm in that
line to expand its production to the utmost, and to reinvest
its profits in more machinery and more employment; it also
attracts new investors and producers from everywhere, until
production in that line is great enough to meet demand, and
the profits in it again fall to (or below) the general average
level.</p>

<p>In a free economy, in which wages, costs and prices are
left to the free play of the competitive market, the prospect
of profits decides what articles will be made, and in what
quantities—and what articles will not be made at all. If
there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the
labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected:
the value of the resources that must be used up in making the
article is greater than the value of the article itself.</p>

<p>One function of profits, in brief, is to guide and channel
the factors of production so as to apportion the relative
output of thousands of different commodities in accordance
with demand. No bureaucrat, no matter how brilliant, can solve
this problem arbitrarily. Free prices and free profits will
maximize production and relieve shortages quicker than any
other system. Arbitrarily fixed prices and arbitrarily limited
profits can only prolong shortages and reduce production and
employment.</p>

<p>The function of profits, finally, is to put constant and
unremitting pressure on the head of every competitive business
to introduce further economies and efficiencies, no matter to
what stage these may already have been brought. In good times
he does this to increase his profits further, in normal times
he does it to keep ahead of his competitors, in bad times he
may have to do it to survive at all. For profits may not only
go to zero, they may quickly turn into losses; and a man will
put forth greater efforts to save himself from ruin than he
will merely to improve his position.</p>

<p>Contrary to a popular impression, profits are achieved not
by raising prices, but by introducing economies and
efficiencies that cut costs of production. It seldom happens
(and unless there is a monopoly it never happens over a long
period) that every firm in an industry makes a profit. The
price charged by all firms for the same commodity or service
must be the same; those who try to charge a higher price do
not find buyers. Therefore the largest profits go to the firms
that have achieved the lowest costs of production. These
expand at the expense of the inefficient firms with higher
costs. It is thus that the consumer and the public are
served.</p>

<p>Profits, in short, resulting from the relationships of
costs to prices, not only tell us which goods it is most
economical to make, but which are the most economical ways to
make them. These questions must be answered by a socialist
system no less than by a capitalist one; they must be answered
by any conceivable economic system; and for the overwhelming
bulk of the commodities and services that are produced, the
answers supplied by profit and loss under competitive free
enterprise are incomparably superior to those that could be
obtained by any other method.</p>

<p>I have been putting my emphasis on the tendency to reduce
costs of production because this is the function of
profit-and-loss that seems to be least appreciated. Greater
profit goes, of course, to the man who makes a <i>better
</i>mousetrap than his neighbor as well as to the man who
makes one more efficiently. But the function of profit in
rewarding and stimulating superior quality and innovation has
always been recognized.</p>
