<p>These are the consequences of what might be described as perfect,”
long-continued, and “nonpolitical” price control. As was so amply
demonstrated in one country after another, particularly in Europe during and
after World War II, some of the more fantastic errors of the bureaucrats
were mitigated by the black market. In some countries the black market kept
growing at the expense of the legally recognized fixed-price market until
the former became, in effect, <i>the </i>market. By nominally keeping the
price ceilings, however, the politicians in power tried to show that their
hearts, if not their enforcement squads, were in the right place.</p>

<p>Because the black market, however, finally supplanted the legal
price-ceiling market, it must not be supposed that no harm was done. The
harm was both economic and moral. During the transition period the large,
long-established firms, with a heavy capital investment and a great
dependence upon the retention of public good-will, are forced to restrict or
discontinue production. Their place is taken by fly-by-night concerns with
little capital and little accumulated experience in production. These new
firms are inefficient compared with those they displace; they turn out
inferior and dishonest goods at much higher production costs than the older
concerns would have required for continuing to turn out their former goods.
A premium is put on dishonesty. The new firms owe their very existence or
growth to the fact that they are willing to violate the law; their customers
conspire with them; and as a natural consequence demoralization spreads into
all business practices.</p>

<p>It is seldom, moreover, that any honest effort is made by the
price-fixing authorities merely to preserve the level of prices existing
when their efforts began. They declare that their intention is to “hold
the line.” Soon, however, under the guise of “correcting inequities”
or “social in justices,” they begin a discriminatory price-fixing which
gives most to those groups that are politically powerful and least to other
groups.</p>

<p>As political power today is most commonly measured by votes, the groups
that the authorities most often attempt to favor are workers and farmers. At
first it is contended that wages and living costs are not connected; that
wages can easily be lifted without lifting prices. When it becomes obvious
that wages can be raised only at the expense of profits, the bureaucrats
begin to argue that profits were already too high anyway, and that lifting
wages and holding prices will still permit a “fair profit.” As there is
no such thing as a uniform <i>rate </i>of profit, as profits differ with
each concern, the result of this policy is to drive the least profitable
concerns out of business altogether, and to discourage or stop the
production of certain items. This means unemployment, a shrinkage in
production and a decline in living standards.</p>
