<p>On the subject of the tariff we must keep in mind one final precaution.
It is the same precaution that we found necessary in examining the effects
of machinery. It is useless to deny that a tariff does benefit—or at least
<i>can benefit—special interests. </i>True, it benefits them <i>at the
expense of eveiyone else. </i>But it does benefit them. If one industry
alone could get protection, while its owners and workers enjoyed the
benefits of free trade in everything else they bought, that industry would
benefit, even on net balance. As an attempt is made to <i>extend </i>the
tariff blessings, however, even people in the protected industries, both as
producers and consum ers, begin to suffer from other people’s protection,
and may finally be worse off even on net balance than if neither they nor
anybody else had protection.</p>

<p>But we should not deny, as enthusiastic free traders have so often done,
the possibility of these tariff benefits to special groups. We should not
pretend, for example, that a reduction of the tariff would help everybody
and hurt nobody. It is true that its reduction would help the country on net
balance. But <i>somebody </i>would be hurt. Groups previously enjoying high
protection would be hurt. That in fact is one reason why it is not good to
bring such protected interests into existence in the first place. But
clarity and candor of thinking compel us to see and acknowledge that some
industries are right when they say that a removal of the tariff on their
product would throw them out of business and throw their workers (at least
temporarily) out of jobs. And if their workers have developed specialized
skills, they may even suffer permanently, or until they have at long last
learnt equal skills. In tracing the effects oftariffs, as in tracing the
effects of machinery, we should endeavor to see <i>all </i>the chief
effects, in both the short run and the long run, on <i>all </i>groups.</p>

<p>As a postscript to this chapter I should add that its argument is not
directed against <i>all </i>tariffs, including duties collected mainly for
revenue, or to keep alive industries needed for war; nor is it directed
against all arguments for tariffs. It is merely directed against the fallacy
that a tariff on net balance “provides employment,” “raises wages,”
or “protects the American standard of living.” It does none of these
things; and so far as wages and the standard of living are concerned, it
does the precise opposite. But an examination of duties imposed for other
purposes would carry us beyond our present subject.</p>

<p>Nor need we here examine the effect of import quotas, exchange controls,
bilateralism and other means of reducing, diverting or preventing
international trade. Such devices have, in general, the same effects as high
or prohibitive tariffs, and often worse effects. They present more
complicated issues, but their net results can be traced through the same
kind of reasoning that we have just applied to tariff barriers.</p>
