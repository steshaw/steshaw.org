<p>What lies at the base of the whole effort to fix maximum prices? There is
first of all a misunderstanding of what it is that has been causing prices
to rise. The real cause is either a scarcity of goods or a surplus of money.
Legal price ceilings cannot cure either. In fact, as we have just seen, they
merely intensify the shortage of goods. What to do about the surplus of
money will be discussed in a later chapter. But one of the errors that lie
behind the drive for price-fixing is the chief subject of this book. Just as
the endless plans for raising prices of favored commodities are the result
of thinking of the interests only of the producers immediately concerned,
and forgetting the interests of consumers, so the plans for holding down
prices by legal edict are the result of thinking of the short-run interests
of people only as consumers and forgetting their interests as producers. And
the political support for such policies springs from a similar confusion in
the public mind. People do not want to pay more for milk, butter, shoes,
furniture, rent, theater tickets or diamonds. Whenever any of these items
rises above its previous level the consumer becomes indignant, and feels
that he is being rooked.</p>

<p>The only exception is the item he makes himself: here he understands and
appreciates the reason for the rise. But he is always likely to regard his
own business as in some way an exception. “Now my own business,” he will
say, “is peculiar, and the public does not understand it. Labor costs have
gone up; raw material prices have gone up; this or that raw material is no
longer being imported, and must be made at a higher cost at home. Moreover,
the demand for the product has increased, and the business should be allowed
to charge the prices necessary to encourage its expansion to supply this
demand.” And so on. Everyone as consumer buys a hundred different
products; as producer he makes, usually, only one. He can see the inequity
in holding down the price of <i>that. </i>And just as each manufacturer
wants a higher price for his particular product, so each worker wants a
higher wage or salary. Each can see as producer that price control is
restricting production in his line. But nearly everyone refuses to
generalize this observation, for it means that he will have to pay more for
the products of <i>others.</i></p>

<p>Each one of us, in brief, has a multiple economic personality. Each one
of us is producer, taxpayer, consumer. The policies he advocates depend upon
the particular aspect under which he thinks of himself at the moment. For he
is sometimes Dr. Jekyll and sometimes Mr. Hyde. As a producer he wants
inflation (thinking chiefly of his own services or product); as a consumer
he wants price ceilings (thinking chiefly of what he has to pay for the
products of others). As a consumer he may advocate or acquiesce in
subsidies; as a taxpayer he will resent paying them. Each person is likely
to think that he can so manage the political forces that he can benefit from
a rise for his own product (while his raw material costs are legally held
down) and at the same time benefit as a consumer from price control. But the
overwhelming majority will be deceiving themselves. For not only must there
be at least as much loss as gain from this political manipulation of prices;
there must be a great deal more loss than gain, because price-fixing
discourages and disrupts employment and production.</p>
