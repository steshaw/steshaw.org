<p>It is often sadly remarked that the bad economists present their errors to the
public better than the good economists present their truths. It is often complained
that demagogues can be more plausible in putting forward economic nonsense from the
platform than the honest men who try to show what is wrong with it. But the basic
reason for this ought not to be mysterious. The reason is that the demagogues and
bad economists are presenting half-truths. They are speaking only of the immediate
effect of a proposed policy or its effect upon a single group. As far as they go
they may often be right. In these cases the answer consists in showing that the
proposed policy would also have longer and less desirable effects, or that it could
benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The answer consists in
supplementing and correcting the half-truth with the other half. But to consider
all the chief effects of a proposed course on everybody often requires a long,
complicated, and dull chain of reasoning. Most of the audience finds this chain of
reasoning difficult to follow and soon becomes bored and inattentive. The bad
economists rationalize this intellectual debility and laziness by assuring the
audience that it need not even attempt to follow the reasoning or judge it on its
merits because it is only “classicism” or “laissez faire” or “capitalist
apologetics” or whatever other term of abuse may happen to strike them as
effective.</p><p
 
 
>We have stated the nature of the lesson, and of the fallacies that stand in its
way, in abstract terms. But the lesson will not be driven home, and the fallacies
will continue to go unrecognized, unless both are illustrated by examples. Through
these examples we can move from the most elementary problems in economics to the
most complex and difficult. Through them we can learn to detect and avoid first the
crudest and most palpable fallacies and finally some of the most sophisticated and
elusive. To that task we shall now proceed.</p><p>
