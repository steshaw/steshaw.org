<p>Now let us look at the matter the other way round, and see the effect of
imposing a tariff in the first place. Suppose that there had been no tariff
on foreign knit goods, that Americans were accustomed to buying foreign
sweaters without duty, and that the argument were then put forward that we
could <i>bring a sweater industry into existence</i> by imposing a duty of
$5 on sweaters.</p>

<p>There would be nothing logically wrong with this argument so far as it
went. The cost of British sweaters to the American consumer might thereby be
forced so high that American manufacturers would find it profitable to enter
the sweater business. But American consumers would be forced to subsidize
this industry. On every American sweater they bought they would be forced in
effect to pay a tax of $5 which would be collected from them in a higher
price by the new sweater industry.</p>

<p>Americans would be employed in a sweater industry who had not previously
been employed in a sweater industry. That much is true. But there would be
no net addition to the country’s industry or the country’s employment.
Because the American consumer had to pay $5 more for the same quality of
sweater he would have just that much less left over to buy anything else. He
would have to reduce his expenditures by $5 somewhere else. In order that
one industry might grow or come into existence, a hundred other industries
would have to shrink. In order that 50,000 persons might be employed in a
woolen sweater industry, 50,000 fewer persons would be employed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the new industry would be <i>visible.</i> The number of its
employees, the capital invested in it, the market value of its product in
terms of dollars, could be easily counted. The neighbors could see the
sweater workers going to and from the factory every day. The results would
be palpable and direct. But the shrinkage of a hundred other industries, the
loss of 50,000 other jobs somewhere else, would not be so easily noticed. it
would be impossible for even the cleverest statistician to know precisely
what the incidence of the loss of other jobs had been—precisely how many
men and women had been laid off from each particular industry, precisely how
much business each particular industry had lost—because consumers had to
pay more for their sweaters. For a loss spread among all the other
productive activities of the country would be comparatively minute for each.
It would be impossible for anyone to know precisely how each consumer
<i>would </i>have spent his extra $5 if he had been allowed to retain it.
The overwhelming majority of the people, therefore, would probably suffer
from the illusion that the new industry had cost us nothing.</p>
