<p><span class="intro">Government “encouragement”
to</span> business is sometimes as much to be feared as
government hostility. This supposed encouragement often takes
the form of a direct grant of government credit or a guarantee
of private loans.</p>

<p>The question of government credit can often be complicated,
because it involves the possibility of inflation. We shall
defer analysis of the effects of inflation of various kinds
until a later chapter. Here, for the sake of simplicity, we
shall assume that the credit we are discussing is
noninflationary. Inflation, as we shall later see, while it
complicates the analysis, does not at bottom change the
consequences of the policies discussed.</p>

<p>A frequent proposal of this sort in Congress is for
more credit to farmers. In the eyes of most congressmen the farmers simply
cannot get enough credit. The credit supplied by private mortgage companies,
insurance companies or country banks is never “adequate.” Congress is always
finding new gaps that are not filled by the existing lending institutions, no
matter how many of these it has itself already brought into existence. The
farmers may have enough long-term credit or enough short-term credit but, it
turns out, they have not enough “intermediate” credit; or the interest rate is
too high; or the complaint is that private loans are made only to rich and
well-established farmers. So new lending institutions and new types of farm
loans are piled on top of each other by the legislature.</p>

<p>The faith in all these policies, it will be found,
springs from two acts of shortsightedness. One is to look at the matter only
from the standpoint of the farmers that borrow. The other is to think only of the first half of the
transaction.</p>

<p>Now all loans, in the eyes of honest borrowers, must
eventually be repaid. All credit is debt. Proposals for an increased volume of
credit, therefore, are merely another name for proposals for an increased
burden of debt. They would seem considerably less inviting if they were
habitually referred to by the second name instead of by the first.</p>

<p>We need not discuss here the normal loans that are
made to farmers through private sources. They consist of mortgages, of
installment credits for the purchase of automobiles, refrigerators, TV sets, tractors
and other farm machinery, and of bank loans made to carry the farmer along
until he is able to harvest and market his crop and get paid for it. Here we
need concern ourselves only with loans to farmers either made directly by some
government bureau or guaranteed by it.</p>

<p>These loans are of two main types. One is a loan to
enable the farmer to hold his crop off the market. This is an especially
harmful type, but it will be more convenient to consider it later when we come
to the question of government commodity controls. The other is a loan to
provide capital—often to set the farmer up in business by enabling him to buy
the farm itself or a mule or tractor, or all three.</p>

<p>At first glance the case for this type of loan may
seem a strong one. Here is a poor family, it will be said, with no means of
livelihood. It is cruel and wasteful to put them on relief. Buy a farm for
them; set them up in business; make productive and self-respecting citizens of
them; let them add to the total national product and pay the loan off out of
what they produce. Or here is a farmer struggling along with primitive methods
of production because he has not the capital to buy himself a tractor. Lend him
the money for one; let him increase productivity; he can repay the loan out of
the proceeds of his increased crops. In that way you not only enrich him and
put him on his feet; you enrich the whole community by that much added output.
And the loan, concludes the argument,
costs the government and the taxpayers less than nothing, because it is
“self-liquidating.”</p>

<p>Now as a matter of fact that is what happens every
day under the institution of private credit. If a man wishes to buy a farm, and
has, let us say, only half or a third as much money as the farm costs, a
neighbor or a savings bank will lend him the rest in the form of a mortgage on
the farm. If he wishes to buy a tractor, the tractor company itself or a
finance company, will allow him to buy it for one-third of the purchase price
with the rest to be paid off in installments out of earnings that the tractor
itself will help to provide.</p>

<p>But there is a decisive difference between the loans
supplied by private lenders and the loans supplied by a government agency. Each
private lender risks his own funds. (A banker, it is true, risks the funds of
others that have been entrusted to him; but if money is lost he must either
make good out of his own funds or be forced out of business.) When people risk
their own funds they are usually careful in their investigations to determine
the adequacy of the assets pledged and the business acumen and honesty of the
borrower.</p>

<p>If the government operated by the same strict
standards, there would be no good argument for its entering the field at all.
Why do precisely what private agencies already do? But the government almost
invariably operates by different standards. The whole argument for its
entering the lending business, in fact, is that it will make loans to people
who could not get them from private lenders. This is only another way of saying
that the government lenders will take risks with other people’s money (the
taxpayers’) that private lenders will not take with their own money. Sometimes,
in fact, apologists will freely acknowledge that the percentage of losses will
be higher on these government loans than on private loans. But they contend
that this will be more than offset by the added production brought into
existence by the borrowers who pay back, and even by most of the borrowers who
do not pay back.</p>

<p>This argument will seem plausible only as long as we
concentrate our attention on the particular borrowers whom the government
supplies with funds, and overlook the people whom its plan deprives of funds.
For what is really being lent is not money, which is merely the medium of
exchange, but capital. (I have already put the reader on notice that we shall
postpone to a later point the complications introduced by an inflationary
expansion of credit.) What is really being lent, say, is the farm or the tractor
itself. Now the number of farms in existence is limited, and so is the production
of tractors (assuming, especially, that an economic surplus of tractors is not
produced simply at the expense of other things). The farm or tractor that is
lent to A cannot be lent to B. The real question is, therefore, whether A or B
shall get the farm.</p>

<p>This brings us to the respective merits ofA and B,
and what each contributes, or is capable of contributing, to production. A, let
us say, is the man who would get the farm if the government did not intervene.
The local banker or his neighbors know him and know his record. They want to
find employment for their funds. They know that he is a good farmer and an
honest man who keeps his word. They consider him a good risk. He has already,
perhaps, through industry, frugality and foresight, accumulated enough cash to
pay a fourth of the price of the farm. They lend him the other three-fourths;
and he gets the farm.</p>

<p>There is a strange idea abroad, held by all monetary
cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. Credit on the
contrary, is something a man already has. He has it, perhaps, because he
already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which
he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned
it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the
loan. The banker is not giving something for nothing. He feels assured of
repayment. He is merely exchanging a more liquid form of asset or credit for a
less liquid form. Sometimes he makes a mistake, and then it is not only the
banker who suffers, but the whole community; for values which were supposed to
be produced by the lender are not produced and resources are wasted.</p>

<p>Now it is to A, let us say, who has credit that the
banker would make his loan. But the government goes into the lending business in
a charitable frame of mind because, as we say, it is worried about</p>

<p>B. B cannot
get a mortgage or other loans from private lenders because he does not have
credit with them. He has no savings; he has no impressive record as a good
farmer; he is perhaps at the moment on relief. Why not, say the advocates of
government credit, make him a useful and productive member of society by
lending him enough for a farm and a mule or tractor and setting him up in
business?</p>

<p>Perhaps in an individual case it may work out all
right. But it is obvious that in general the people selected by these
government standards will be poorer risks than the people selected by private
standards. More money will be lost by loans to them. There will be a much
higher percentage of failures among them. They will be less efficient. More
resources will be wasted by them. Yet the recipients of government credit will
get their farms and tractors at the expense of those who otherwise would have
been the recipients of private credit. Because B has a farm, A will be deprived
of a farm. A may be squeezed out either because interest rates have gone up as
a result of the government operations, or because farm prices have been forced
up as a result of them, or because there is no other farm to be had in his
neighborhood. In any case, the net result of government credit has not been to
increase the amount of wealth produced by the community but to reduce it,
because the available real capital (consisting of actual farms, tractors, etc.)
has been placed in the hands of the less efficient borrowers rather than in the
hands of the more efficient and trustworthy.</p>
