<p>SPECIAL INTERESTS, as the history of tariffs reminds us, can think of the
most ingenious reasons why they should be the objects of special solicitude.
Their spokesmen present a plan in their favor; and it seems at first so
absurd that disinterested writers do not trouble to expose it. But the
special interests keep on insisting on the scheme. Its enactment would make
so much difference to their own immediate welfare that they can afford to
hire trained economists and public relations experts to propagate it in
their behalf. The public hears the argument so often repeated, and
accompanied by such a wealth of imposing statistics, charts, curves and
pie-slices, that it is soon taken in. When at last disinterested writers
recognize that the danger of the scheme’s enactment is real, they are
usually too late. They cannot in a few weeks acquaint themselves with the
subject as thoroughly as the hired brains who have been devoting their full
time to it for years; they are accused of being uninformed, and they have
the air of men who presume to dispute axioms.</p>

<p>This general history will do as a history of the idea of “parity”
prices for agricultural products. I forget the first day when it made its
appearance in a legislative bill; but with the advent of the New Deal in
1933 it had become a definitely established principle, enacted into law; and
as year succeeded year, and its absurd corollaries made themselves manifest,
they were enacted too.</p>

<p>The argument for parity prices ran roughly like this. Agriculture is the
most basic and important of all industries. It must be preserved at all
costs. Moreover, the prosperity of everybody else depends upon the
prosperity of the farmer. If he does not have the purchasing power to buy
the products of industry, industry languishes. This was the cause of the
1929 collapse, or at least of our failure to recover from it. For the prices
of farm products dropped violently, while the prices of industrial products
dropped very little. The result was that the farmer could not buy industrial
products; the city workers were laid off and could not buy farm products,
and the depression spread in ever-widening vicious circles. There was only
one cure, and it was simple. Bring back the prices of the farmer’s
products to a parity with the prices of the things the farmer buys. This
parity existed in the period from 1909 to 1914, when farmers were
prosperous. That price relationship must be restored and preserved
perpetually.</p>

<p>It would take too long, and carry us too far from our main point, to
examine every absurdity concealed in this plausible statement. There is no
sound reason for taking the particular price relationships that prevailed in
a particular year or period and regarding them as sacrosanct, or even as
necessarily more “normal” than those of any other period. Even if they
were “normal” at the time, what reason is there to suppose that these
same relationships should be preserved more than sixty years later in spite
of the enormous changes in the conditions of production and demand that have
taken place in the meantime? The period of 1909 to 1914, as the basis of
parity, was not selected at random. In terms of relative prices it was one
of the most favorable periods to agriculture in our entire history.</p>

<p>If there had been any sincerity or logic in the idea, it would have been
universally extended. If the price relationships between agricultural and
industrial products that prevailed from August 1909 to July 1914 ought to be
preserved perpetually, why not preserve perpetually the price relationship
of every commodity at that time to every other?</p>

<p>When the first edition of this book appeared in 1946, I used the
following illustrations of the absurdities to which this would have led:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<p>A Chevrolet six-cylinder touring car cost $2,150 in 1912; an
	incomparably improved six-cylinder Chevrolet sedan cost $907 in
	1942; adjusted for “parity” on the same basis as farm products,
	however, it would have cost $3,270 in 1942. A pound of aluminum from
	1909 to 1913 inclusive averaged 22.5 cents; its price early in 1946 was
	14 cents; but at “parity” it would then have cost, instead, 41
	cents.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>It would be both difficult and debatable to try to bring these two
particular comparisons down to date by adjusting not only for the serious
inflation (consumer prices have more than tripled) between 1946 and 1978,
but also for the qualitative differences in automobiles in the two periods.
But this difficulty merely emphasizes the impracticability of the
proposal.</p>

<p>After making, in the 1946 edition, the comparison quoted above, I went on
to point out that the same type of increase in productivity had in part led
also to the lower prices of farm products. “In the five year period 1955
through 1959 an average of 428 pounds of cotton was raised per acre in the
United States as compared with an average of 260 pounds in the five-year
period 1939 to 1943 and an average of only 188 pounds in the five year
‘base’ period 1909 to 1913. When these comparisons are brought down to
date, they show that the increase in farm productivity has continued, though
at a reduced rate. In the five-year period 1968 to 1972, an average of 467
pounds of cotton was raised per acre. Similarly, in the five years 1968 to
1972 an average of 84 bushels of corn per acre was raised compared with an
average of only 26.1 bushels in 1935 to 1939, and an average of 31.3 bushels
of wheat was raised per acre compared with an average of only 13.2 in the
earlier period.</p>

<p>Costs of production have been substantially lowered for farm products by
better application of chemical fertilizer, improved strains of seed and
increasing mechanization. In the 1946 edition I made the following
<A href="#*">quotation:*</a><p>

<blockquote><p>
	“On some large farms which have been completely mechanized and are
	operated along mass production lines, it requires only one-third to
	one-fifth the amount of labor to produce the same yields as it did a few
	years back.”
</blockquote>
<p>Yet all this is ignored by the apostles of “parity” prices.</p>

<p>The refusal to universalize the principle is not the only evidence that
it is not a public-spirited economic plan but merely a device for
subsidizing a special interest. Another evidence is that when agricultural
prices go <i>above </i>parity, or are forced there by government policies,
there is no demand on the part of the farm bloc in Congress that such prices
be brought <i>down </i>to parity, or that the subsidy be to that extent
repaid. It is a rule that works only one way.</p>

<DIV class="footnote"><A NAME="#*">* <i>New York Times, </i></A>January 2, 1946. Of course
the acreage restriction plans themselves helped to bring about the increased
crop yields per acre—first because the acres that farmers took out of
cultivation were naturally their least productive; and secondly, because the
high support price made it profitable to increase the dosage of fertilizer
per acre. Thus the government acreage restriction plans were largely
self-defeating.</DIV>
