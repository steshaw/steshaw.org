<p>So many fallacies have grown up about saving in recent
years that they cannot all be answered by our example of the
two brothers. It is necessary to devote some further space to
them. Many stem from confusions so elementary as to seem
incredible, particularly when found in the works of economic
writers of wide repute. The word <i>saving, </i>for example,
is used sometimes to mean mere <i>hoarding </i>of money, and
sometimes to mean <i>investment, </i>with no clear
distinction, consistently maintained, between the two
uses.</p>

<p>Mere hoarding of hand-to-hand money, if it takes place
irrationally, causelessly, and on a large scale, is in most
economic situations harmful. But this sort of hoarding is
extremely rare. Something that looks like this, but should be
carefully distinguished from it, often occurs <i>after </i>a
downturn in business has got under way. Consumptive spending
and investment are then <i>both </i>contracted. Consumers
reduce their buying. They do this partly, indeed, because they
fear they may lose their jobs, and they wish to conserve their
resources: they have contracted their buying not because they
wish to consume less but because they wish to make sure that
their power to consume will be extended over a longer period
if they do lose their jobs.</p>

<p>But consumers reduce their buying for another reason.
Prices of goods have probably fallen, and they fear a further
fall. If they defer spending, they believe they will get more
for their money. They do not wish to have their resources in
goods that are falling in value, but in money which they
expect (relatively) to rise in value.</p>

<p>The same expectation prevents them from investing. They
have lost their confidence in the profitability of business;
or at least they believe that if they wait a few months they
can buy stocks or bonds cheaper. We may think of them either
as refusing to hold goods that may fall in value on their
hands, or as holding money itself for a rise.</p>

<p>It is a misnomer to call this temporary refusal to buy
“saving.” It does not spring from the same motives as
normal saving. And it is a still more serious error to say
that this sort of “saving” is the <i>cause </i>of
depressions. It is, on the contrary, the <i>consequence </i>of
depressions.</p>

<p>It is true that this refusal to buy may intensify and
prolong a depression. At times when there is capricious
government intervention in business, and when business does
not know what the government is going to do next, uncertainty
is created. Profits are not reinvested. Firms and individuals
allow cash balances to accumulate in their banks. They keep
larger reserves against contingencies. This hoarding of cash
may seem like a cause of a subsequent slowdown in business
activity. The real cause, however, is the uncertainty brought
about by the government policies. The larger cash balances of
firms and individuals are merely one link in the chain of
consequences from that uncertainty. To blame “excessive
saving” for the business decline would be like blaming a
fall in the price of apples not on a bumper crop but on the
people who refuse to pay more for apples.</p>

<p>But when once people have decided to deride a practice or
an institution, any argument against it, no matter how
illogical, is considered good enough. It is said that the
various consumers goods industries are built on the
expectation of a certain demand, and that if people take to
saving they will disappoint this expectation and start a
depression. This assertion rests primarily on the error we
have already examined—that of forgetting that what is saved
on consumers’ goods is spent on capital goods, and that
“saving” does not necessarily mean even a dollar’s
contraction in <i>total </i>spending. The only element of
truth in the contention is that <i>any </i>change that is
<i>sudden </i>may be unsettling. It would be just as
unsettling if consumers suddenly switched their demand from
one consumers’ good to another. It would be even more
unsettling if former savers suddenly switched their demand
from capital goods to consumers’ goods</p>

<p>Still another objection is made against saving. It is said
to be just downright silly. The nineteenth century is derided
for its supposed inculcation of the doctrine that mankind
through saving should go on baking itself a larger and larger
cake without ever eating the cake. This picture of the process
is itself naive and childish. It can best be disposed of,
perhaps, by putting before ourselves a somewhat more realistic
picture of what actually takes place.</p>

<p>Let us picture to ourselves, then, a nation that
collectively saves every year about 20 percent of all it
produces in that year. This figure greatly overstates the
amount of net saving that has occurred historically in the
United States,<A href="#*"><sup>[*]</sup></a> but it is a
round figure that is easily handled, and it gives the benefit
of every doubt to those who believe that we have been
“oversaving.”</p>

<p>Now as a result of this annual saving and investment, the
total annual production of the country will increase each
year. (To isolate the problem we are ignoring for the moment
booms, slumps, or other fluctuations.) Let us say that this
annual increase in production is 2.5 percentage points.
(Percentage points are taken instead of a compounded
percentage merely to simplify the arithmetic.) The picture
that we get for an eleven-year period, say, would then run
something like this in terms of index numbers:</p>

</TABLE>


<p>The first thing to be noticed about this table is that
total production increases each year <i>because of the saving,
</i>and would not have increased without it. (It is possible
no doubt to imagine that improvements and new inventions
merely in <i>replaced </i>machinery and other capital goods of
a value no greater than the old would increase the national
productivity; but this increase would amount to very little
and the argument in any case assumes enough prior investment
to have made the existing machinery possible.) The saving has
been used year after year to increase the quantity or improve
the quality of existing machinery, and so to increase the
nation’s output of goods. There is, it is true (if that for
some strange reason is considered an objection), a larger and
larger “cake” each year. Each year, it is true, not <i>all
</i>of the currently produced cake is consumed. But there is
no irrational or cumulative restraint. For each year a larger
and larger cake is in fact consumed; until, at the end of
eleven years (in our illustration), the annual consumers’
cake alone is equal to the combined consumers’ and
producers’ cakes of the first year. Moreover, the capital
equipment, the ability to produce goods, is itself 25 percent
greater than in the first year.</p>

<p>Let us observe a few other points. The fact that 20 percent
of the national income goes each year for saving does not
upset the consumers’ goods industries in the least. If they
sold only the 80 units they produced in the first year (and
there were no rise in prices caused by unsatisfied demand)
they would certainly not be foolish enough to build their
production plans on the assumption that they were going to
sell 100 units in the second year. The consumers’ goods
industries, in other words, are <i>already geared </i>to the
assumption that the past situation in regard to the rate of
savings will continue. Only an unexpected <i>sudden and
substantial increase </i>in savings would unsettle them and
leave them with unsold goods.</p>

<p>But the same unsettlement, as we have already observed,
would be caused in the <i>capital </i>goods industries by a
sudden and substantial <i>decrease </i>in savings. If money
that would previously have been used for savings were thrown
into the purchase of consumers goods, it would not increase
employment but merely lead to an increase in the price of
consumption goods and to a decrease in the price of capital
goods. Its first effect on net balance would be to force
shifts in employment and temporarily to <i>decrease
</i>employment by its effect on the capital goods industries.
And its long-run effect would be to reduce production below
the level that would otherwise have been achieved.</p>

<div class =footnote><A NAME="*">* Historically</a> 20 percent
would represent approximately the <i>gross</i> amount of the
gross national product devoted each year to capital formation
(excluding consumers’ equipment). When allowance is made for
capital consumption. however, <i>net </i>annual savings have
been closer to 12 percent. Cf. George Terborgh, <i>The Bogey
of Economic Maturity (1945).</i> For 1977 gross private
domestic investment was officially estimated at 16 percent of
the gross national product.</div>
