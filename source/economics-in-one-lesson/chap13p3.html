<p>There is one argument for parity prices that should be dealt with before
we leave the subject. It is put forward by some of the more sophisticated
defenders. ‘Yes,” they will freely admit, “the economic arguments for
parity prices are unsound. Such prices are a special privilege. They are an
imposition on the consumer. But isn’t the tariff an imposition on the
farmer? Doesn’t he have to pay higher prices on industrial products
because of it? It would do no good to place a compensating tariff on farm
products because America is a net exporter of farm products. Now the
parity-price system is the farmer’s equivalent of the tariff. It is the
only fair way to even things up.</p>

<p>The farmers that asked for parity prices did have a legitimate complaint.
The protective tariff injured them more than they knew. By reducing
industrial imports it also reduced American farm exports, because it
prevented foreign nations from getting the dollar exchange needed for taking
our agricultural products. And it provoked retaliatory tariffs in other
countries. Nonetheless, the argument we have just quoted will not stand
examination. It is wrong even in its implied statement of the facts. There
is no <i>general</i> tariff on all “industrial” products or on all
nonfarm products. There are scores of domestic industries or of exporting
industries that have no tariff protection. If the city worker has to pay a
higher price for woolen blankets or overcoats because of a tariff, is he
“compensated” by having to pay a higher price also for cotton clothing
and for foodstuffs? Or is he merely being robbed twice?</p>

<p>Let us even it all out, say some, by giving equal “protection” to
everybody. But that is insoluble and impossible. Even if we assume that the
problem could be solved technically—a tariff for A, an industrialist
subject to foreign competition; a subsidy for B, an industrialist who
exports his product—it would be impossible to protect or to subsidize
everybody “fairly” or equally. We should have to give everyone the same
percentage (or should it be the same dollar amount?) of tariff protection or
subsidy, and we could never be sure when we were duplicating payments to
some groups or leaving gaps with others.</p>

<p>But suppose we could solve this fantastic problem? What would be the
point? Who gains when everyone equally subsidizes everyone else? What is the
profit when everyone loses in added taxes precisely what he gains by his
subsidy or his protection? We should merely have added an army of needless
bureaucrats to carry out the program, with all of them lost to
production.</p>

<p>We could solve the matter simply, on the other hand, by ending both the
parity-price system and the protective-tariff system. Meanwhile they do not,
in combination, even out anything. The joint system means merely that Farmer
A and Industrialist B both profit at the expense of Forgotten Man C.</p>

<p>So the alleged benefits of still another scheme evaporate as soon as we
trace not only its immediate effects on a special group but its long-run
effects on everyone.</p>
