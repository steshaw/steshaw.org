<p>Our aim here is not to trace all the results that followed historically
from efforts to save particular industries, but to trace a few of the chief
results that must necessarily follow from efforts to save an industry.</p>

<p>It may be argued that a given industry must be created or preserved for
military reasons. It may be argued that a given industry is being ruined by
taxes or wage rates disproportionate to those of other industries; or that,
if a public utility, it is being forced to operate at rates or charges to
the public that do not permit an adequate profit margin. Such arguments may
or may not be justified in a particular case. We are not concerned with them
here. We are concerned only with a single argument for saving the X
industry—that if it is allowed to shrink in size or perish through the
forces of free competition (always called by spokesmen for the industry in
such cases laissez-faire, anarchic, cutthroat, dog-eatdog, law-of-the-jungle
competition) it will pull down the general economy with it, and that if it
is artificially kept alive it will help everybody else.</p>

<p>What we are talking about here is nothing else but a generalized case of
the argument put forward for parity prices for farm products or for tariff
protection for any number of X industries. The argument against artificially
higher prices applies, of course, not only to farm products but to any
product, just as the reasons we have found for opposing tariff protection
for one industry apply to any other.</p>

<p>But there are always any number of schemes for saving X industries. There
are two main types of such proposals in addition to those we have already
considered, and we shall take a brief glance at them. One is to contend that
the X industry is already “overcrowded,” and to try to prevent other
firms or workers from getting into it. The other is to argue that the X
industry needs to be supported by a direct subsidy from the government.</p>

<p>Now if the X industry is really overcrowded as compared with other
industries it will not need any coercive legislation to keep out new capital
or new workers. New capital does not rush into industries that are obviously
dying. Investors do not eagerly seek the industries that present the highest
risks of loss combined with the lowest returns. Nor do workers, when they
have any better alternative, go into industries where the wages are lowest
and the prospects for steady employment least promising.</p>

<p>If new capital and new labor are forcibly kept out of the X industry,
however, either by monopolies, cartels, union policy or legislation, it
deprives this capital and labor of liberty of choice. It forces investors to
place their money where the returns seem less promising to them than in the
X industry. It forces workers into industries with even lower wages and
prospects than they could find in the allegedly sick X industry. It means,
in short, that both capital and labor are less efficiently employed than
they would be if they were permitted to make their own free choices. It
means, therefore, a lowering of production which must reflect itself in a
lower average living standard.</p>

<p>That lower living standard will be brought about either by lower average
money wages than would otherwise prevail or by higher average living costs,
or by a combination of both. (The exact result would depend upon the
accompanying monetary policy.) By these restrictive policies wages and
capital returns might indeed be kept higher than otherwise within the X
industry itself; but wages and capital returns in other industries would be
forced down lower than otherwise. The X industry would benefit only at the
expense of the A, B and C industries.</p>
