<p>A MERE RECITAL of the economic policies of governments all over the world
is calculated to cause any serious student of economics to throw up his
hands in despair. What possible point can there be, he is likely to ask, in
discussing refinements and advances in economic theory, when popular thought
and the actual policies of governments, certainly in everything connected
with international relations, have not yet caught up with Adam Smith? For
present-day tariff and trade policies are not only as bad as those in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but incomparably worse. The real
reasons for those tariffs and other trade barriers are the same, and the
pretended reasons are also the same.</p>

<p>Since <i>The Wealth of </i>Nations appeared more than two centuries ago,
the case for free trade has been stated thousands of times, but perhaps
never with more direct simplicity and force than it was stated in that
volume. In general Smith rested his case on one fundamental proposition:
“In every country it always is and must be the interest of the great body
of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest.”
“The proposition is so very manifest,” Smith continued, “that it seems
ridiculous to take any pains to prove it; nor could it ever have been called
in question, had not the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers
confounded the common-sense of mankind.”</p>

<p>From another point of view, free trade was considered as one aspect of
the specialization of labor:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to
	attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than
	to buy.</p>

	<p>The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of
	the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes,
	but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor
	the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it
	for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they
	have some advantage over their neighbors, and to purchase with a part of
	its produce, or what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it,
	whatever else they have occasion for. What is prudence in the conduct of
	every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But whatever led people to suppose that what was prudence in the conduct
of every private family <i>could </i>be folly in that of a great kingdom? It
was a whole network of fallacies, out of which mankind has still been unable
to cut its way. And the chief of them was the central fallacy with which
this book is concerned. It was that of considering merely the immediate
effects of a tariff on special groups, and neglecting to consider its long
run effects on the whole community.</p>
