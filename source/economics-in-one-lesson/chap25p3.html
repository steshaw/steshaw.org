<p>In the course of our study, also, we have rediscovered an
old friend. He is the Forgotten Man of William Graham Sumner.
The reader will remember that in Sumner’s essay, which
appeared in 1883:</p>

	<blockquote> <p>As soon as A observes something which
	seems to him to be wrong, from which X is suffering, A
	talks it over with B, and A and B then propose to get a
	law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their law always
	proposes to determine what C shall do for <i>X </i>or, in
	the better case, what A, B and C shall do for <i>...
	</i><b>.. </b>What I want to do is to look up C.... I call
	him the Forgotten Man.... He is the man who never is
	thought of. He is the victim of the reformer, social
	speculator and philanthropist, and I hope to show you
	before I get through that he deserves your notice both for
	his character and for the many burdens which are laid upon
	him.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is a historic irony that when this phrase, the Forgotten
Man, was revived in the 1930s, it was applied, not to C, but
to X; and C, who was then being asked to support still more
Xs, was more completely forgotten than ever. It is C, the
Forgotten Man, who is always called upon to stanch the
politician’s bleeding heart by paying for his vicarious
generosity.</p>
