<p><span class="intro">I have</span> found it necessary to
warn the reader from time to time that a certain result would
necessarily follow from a certain policy “provided there is
no inflation.” In the chapters on public works and on credit
I said that a study of the complications introduced by
inflation would have to be deferred. But money and monetary
policy form so intimate and sometimes so inextricable a part
of every economic process that this separation, even for
expository purposes, was very difficult and in the chapters on
the effect of various government or union wage policies on
employment, profits and production, some of the effects of
differing monetary policies had to be considered
immediately.</p>

<p>Before we consider what the consequences of inflation are
in specific cases, we should consider what its consequences
are in general. Even prior to that, it seems desirable to ask
why inflation has been constantly resorted to, why it has had
an immemorial popular appeal, and why its siren music has
tempted one nation after another down the path to economic
disaster.</p>

<p>The most obvious and yet the oldest and most stubborn error
on which the appeal of inflation rests is that of confusing
“money” with wealth. “That wealth consists in money, or
in gold and silver” wrote Adam Smith more than two centuries
ago “is a popular notion which naturally arises from the
double function of money, as the instrument of commerce, and
as the measure of value.... To grow rich is to get money, and
wealth and money, in short, are, in common language,
considered as in every respect synonymous.</p>

<p>Real wealth, of course, consists in what is produced and
consumed: the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the houses we
live</p>

<p>in. It is railways and roads and motor cars; ships and
planes and factories; schools and churches and theaters;
pianos, paintings and books. Yet so powerful is the verbal
ambiguity that confuses money with wealth, that even those who
at times recognize the confusion will slide back into it in
the course of their reasoning. Each man sees that if he
personally had more money he could buy more things from
others. If he had twice as much money he could buy twice as
many things; if he had three times as much money he would be
“worth” three times as much. And to many the conclusion
seems obvious that if the government merely issued more money
and distributed it to everybody, we should all be that much
richer.</p>

<p>These are the most naive inflationists. There is a second
group, less naive, who see that if the whole thing were as
easy as that the government could solve all our problems
merely by printing money. They sense that there must be a
catch somewhere; so they would limit in some way the amount of
additional money they would have the government issue. They
would have it print just enough to make up some alleged
“deficiency,” or “gap.”</p>

<p>Purchasing power is chronically deficient, they think,
because industry somehow does not distribute enough money to
producers to enable them to buy back, as consumers, the
product that is made. There is a mysterious “leak”
somewhere. One group “proves” it by equations. On one side
of their equations they count an item only once; on the other
side they unknowingly count the same item several times over.
This produces an alarming gap between what they call “A
payments” and what they call “A+B payments.” So they
found a movement, put on green uniforms, and insist that the
government issue money or “credits” to make good the
missing B payments.</p>

<p>The cruder apostles of “social credit” may seem
ridiculous; but there are an indefinite number of schools of
only slightly more sophisticated inflationists who have
“scientific” plans to issue just enough additional money
or credit to fill some alleged chronic or periodic deficiency,
or gap, which they calculate in some other way.</p>
