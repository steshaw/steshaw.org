<p>The analysis of our illustrations has taught us another
incidental lesson. This is that, when we study the effects of
various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short
run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we
arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated
common sense. It would not occur to anyone unacquainted with
the prevailing economic half-literacy that it is good to have
windows broken and cities destroyed; that it is anything but
waste to create needless public projects; that it is dangerous
to let idle hordes of men return to work; that machines which
increase the production of wealth and economize human effort
are to be dreaded; that obstructions to free production and
free consumption increase wealth; that a nation grows richer
by forcing other nations to take its goods for less than they
cost to produce; that saving is stupid or wicked and that
squandering brings prosperity.</p>

<p>“What is prudence in the conduct of every private
family,” said Adam Smith’s strong common sense in reply to
the sophists of his time, “can scarce be folly in that of a
great kingdom.” But lesser men get lost in complications.
They do not reexamine their reasoning even when they emerge
with conclusions that are palpably absurd. The reader,
depending upon his own beliefs, may or may not accept the
aphorism of Bacon that “A little philosophy inclineth
men’s minds to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth
men’s minds about to religion.” It is certainly true,
however, that a little economics can easily lead to the
paradoxical and preposterous conclusions we have just
rehearsed, but that depth in economics brings men back to
common sense. For depth in economics consists in looking for
all the consequences of a policy instead of merely resting
one’s gaze on those immediately visible.</p>
