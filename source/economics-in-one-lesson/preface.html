<p><span class="intro">This book is</span> an analysis of economic fallacies that are at last so prevalent that
they have almost become a new orthodoxy. The one thing that has prevented this has been their own
self-contradictions, which have scattered those who accept the same premises into a hundred
different &ldquo;schools,&rdquo; for the simple reason that it is impossible in matters touching
practical life to be consistently wrong. But the difference between one new school and another is
merely that one group wakes up earlier than another to the absurdities to which its false premises
are driving it, and becomes at that moment inconsistent by either unwittingly abandoning its false
premises or accepting conclusions from them less disturbing or fantastic than those that logic
would demand.</p><p

>There is not a major government in the world at this moment, however, whose economic policies are
not influenced if they are not almost wholly determined by acceptance of some of these fallacies.
Perhaps the shortest and surest way to an understanding of economics is through a dissection of
such errors, and particularly of the central error from which they stem. That is the assumption of
this volume and of its somewhat ambitious and belligerent title.</p><p

>The volume is therefore primarily one of exposition. It makes no claim to originality with regard
to any of the chief ideas that it expounds. Rather its effort is to show that many of the ideas
which now pass for brilliant innovations and advances are in fact mere revivals of ancient errors,
and a further proof of the dictum that those who are ignorant of the past are condemned to repeat
it. &gt;The present essay itself is, I suppose, unblushingly &ldquo;classical,&rdquo;
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo;; at least these are the epithets with which
those whose sophisms are here subjected to analysis will no doubt attempt to dismiss it. But the
student whose aim is to attain as much truth as possible will not be frightened by such
adjectives. He will not be forever seeking a revolution, a &ldquo;fresh start,&rdquo; in economic
thought. His mind will, of course, be as receptive to new ideas as to old ones; but he will be
content to put aside merely restless or exhibitionistic straining for novelty and originality. As
Morris R. Cohen has <a href="#*">remarked *</a>: &ldquo;The notion that we can dismiss the views
of all previous thinkers surely leaves no basis for the hope that our own work will prove of any
value to others.&rdquo; Because this is a work of exposition I have availed myself freely and
without detailed acknowledgment (except for rare footnotes and quotations) of the ideas of others.
This is inevitable when one writes in a field in which many of the world's finest minds have
labored. But my indebtedness to at least three writers is of so specific a nature that I cannot
allow it to pass unmentioned. My greatest debt, with respect to the kind of expository framework
on which the present argument is hung, is to Frederic Bastiat's essay <i>Ce qu `on voit et ce
qu'on ne voit pas, </i>now nearly a century old. The present work may, in fact, be regarded as a
modernization, extension and generalization of the approach found in Bastiat's pamphlet. My second
debt is to Philip Wicksteed: in particular the chapters on wages and the final summary chapter owe
much to his <i>Common-sense of Political Economy. </i>My third debt is to Ludwig von Mises.
Passing over everything that this elementary treatise may owe to his writings in general, my most
specific debt is to his exposition of the manner in which the process of monetary inflation is
spread.</p><p

>When analyzing fallacies, I have thought it still less advisable to mention particular names than
in giving credit. To do so would have required special justice to each writer criticized, with
exact quotations, account taken of the particular emphasis he places on this point or that, the
qualifications he makes, his personal ambiguities, inconsistencies, and so on. I hope, therefore,
that no one will be too disappointed at the absence of such names as Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen,
Major Douglas, Lord Keynes, Professor Alvin Hansen and others in these pages. The object of this
book is not to expose the special errors of particular writers, but economic errors in their most
frequent, widespread or influential form. Fallacies, when they have reached the popular stage,
become anonymous anyway. The subtleties or obscurities to be found in the authors most responsible
for propagating them are washed off. A doctrine becomes simplified; the sophism that may have been
buried in a network of qualifications, ambiguities or mathematical equations stands clear. I hope
I shall not be accused of injustice on the ground, therefore, that a fashionable doctrine in the
form in which I have presented it is not precisely the doctrine as it has been formulated by Lord
Keynes or some other special author. It is the beliefs which politically influential groups hold
and which governments act upon that we are interested in here, not the historical origins of those
beliefs.</p><p

>I hope, finally, that I shall be forgiven for making such rare reference to statistics in the
following pages. To have tried to present statistical confirmation, in referring to the effects of
tariffs, price-fixing, inflation, and the controls over such commodities as coal, rubber and
cotton, would have swollen this book much beyond the dimensions contemplated. As a working
newspaper man, moreover, I am acutely aware of how quickly statistics become out of date and are
superseded by later figures. Those who are interested in specific economic problems are advised to
read current ``realistic'' discussions of them, with statistical documentation: they will not find
it difficult to interpret the statistics correctly in the light of the basic principles they have
learned.</p><p

>I have tried to write this book as simply and with as much freedom from technicalities as is
consistent with reasonable accuracy, so that it can be fully understood by a reader with no
previous acquaintance with economics.</p><p

>While this book was composed as a unit, three chapters have already appeared as separate
articles, and I wish to thank the <i>New York Times, </i>the <i>American Scholar </i>and the
<i>New Leader </i>for permission to reprint material originally published in their pages. I am
grateful to Professor von Mises for reading the manuscript and for helpful suggestions.
Responsibility for the opinions expressed is, of course, entirely my own.</p><p
