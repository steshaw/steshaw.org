<p>The more knowing inflationists recognize that any
substantial increase in the quantity of money will reduce the
purchasing power of each individual monetary unit—in other
words, that it will lead to an increase in commodity prices.
But this does not disturb them. On the contrary, it is
precisely why they want the inflation. Some of them argue that
this result will improve the position of poor debtors as
compared with rich creditors. Others think it will stimulate
exports and discourage imports. Still others think it is an
essential measure to cure a depression, to “start industry
going again, and to achieve <A href="#*">“full
employment.”<sup>[*]</sup></a></p>

<p>There are innumerable theories concerning the way in which
increased quantities of money (including bank credit) affect
prices. On the one hand, as we have just seen, are those who
imagine that the quantity of money could be increased by
almost any amount without affecting prices. They merely see
this increased money as a means of increasing everyone’s
“purchasing power,” in the sense of enabling everybody to
buy more goods than before. Either they never stop to remind
themselves that people collectively cannot buy twice as much
goods as before unless twice as much goods are produced, or
they imagine that the only thing that holds down an indefinite
increase in production is not a shortage of manpower, working
hours or productive capacity, but merely a shortage of
monetary demand: if people want the goods, they assume, and
have the money to pay for them, the goods will almost
automatically be produced.</p>

<p>On the other hand is the group—and it has included some
eminent economists—that holds a rigid mechanical theory of
the effect of the supply of money on commodity prices. All the
money in a nation, as these theorists picture the matter, will
be offered against all the goods. Therefore the value of the
total quantity of money multiplied by its “velocity of
circulation” must always be equal to the value of the total
quantity of goods bought. Therefore, further (assuming no
change in velocity of circulation), the value of the monetary
unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into
circulation. Double the quantity of money and bank credit and
you exactly double the “price level”; triple it, and you
exactly triple the price level. Multiply the quantity of money
<i>n </i>times, in short, and you must multiply the prices of
goods <i>n </i>times.</p>

<p>There is not space here to explain all the fallacies in <A
href="#†"> this plausible picture.<sup>[†]</sup></A> Instead
we shall try to see just why and how an increase in the
quantity of money raises prices.</p>

<p>An increased quantity of money comes into existence in a
specific way. Let us say that it comes into existence because
the government makes larger expenditures than it can or wishes
to meet out of the proceeds of taxes (or from the sale of
bonds paid for by the people out of real savings). Suppose,
for example, that the government prints money to pay war
contractors. Then the first effect of these expenditures will
be to raise the prices of supplies used in war and to put
additional money into the hands of the war contractors and
their employees. (As, in our chapter on price-fixing, we
deferred for the sake of simplicity some complications
introduced by an inflation, so, in now considering inflation,
we may pass over the complications introduced by an attempt at
government price-fixing. When these are considered it will be
found that they do not change the essential analysis. They
lead merely to a sort of backed—up or “repressed”
inflation that reduces or conceals some of the earlier
consequences at the expense of aggravating the later
ones.)</p>

<p>The war contractors and their employees, then, will have
higher money incomes. They will spend them for the particular
goods and services they want. The sellers of these goods and
services will be able to raise their prices because of this
increased demand. Those who have the increased money income
will be willing to pay these higher prices rather than do
without the goods; for they will have more money, and a dollar
will have a smaller subjective value in the eyes of each of
them.</p>

<p>Let us call the war contractors and their employees group
A, and those from whom they directly buy their added goods and
services group B. Group B, as a result of higher sales and
prices, will now in turn buy more goods and services from a
still further group, C. Group C in turn will be able to raise
its prices and will have more income to spend on group D, and
so on, until the rise in prices and money incomes has covered
virtually the whole nation. When the process has been
completed, nearly everybody will have a higher income measured
in terms of money. But (assuming that production of goods and
services has not increased) prices of goods and services will
have increased correspondingly. The nation will be no richer
than before.</p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that everyone’s relative or
absolute wealth and income will remain the same as before. On
the contrary, the process of inflation is certain to affect
the fortunes of one group differently from those of another.
The first groups to receive the additional money will benefit
the most. The money incomes of group A, for example, will have
increased before prices have increased, so that they will be
able to buy almost a proportionate increase in goods. The
money incomes of group B will advance later, when prices have
already increased somewhat; but group B will be better off in
terms of goods. Meanwhile, however, the groups that have still
had no advance whatever in their money incomes will find
themselves compelled to pay higher prices for the things they
buy, which means that they will be obliged to get along on a
lower standard of living than before.</p>

<p>We may clarify the process further by a hypothetical set of
figures. Suppose we divide the community arbitrarily into four
main groups of producers, A, B, C and D, who get the money
income benefit of the inflation in that order. Then when money
incomes of group A have already increased 30 percent, the
prices of the things they purchase have not yet increased at
all. By the time money incomes of group B have increased 20
percent, prices have still increased an average of only 10
percent. When money incomes of group C have increased only 10
percent, however, prices have already gone up 15 percent. And
when money incomes of group D have not yet increased at all,
the average prices they have to pay for the things they buy
have gone up 20 percent. In other words, the gains of the
first groups of producers to benefit by higher prices or wages
from the inflation are necessarily at the expense of the
losses suffered (as consumers) by the last groups of producers
that are able to raise their prices or wages.</p>

<p>It may be that, if the inflation is brought to a halt after
a few years, the final result will be, say, an average
increase of 25 percent in money incomes, and an average
increase in prices of an equal amount, both of which are
fairly distributed among all groups. But this will not cancel
out the gains and losses of the transition period. Group D,
for example, even though its own incomes and prices have at
last advanced 25 percent, will be able to buy only as much
goods and services as before the inflation started. It will
never compensate for its losses during that period when its
income and prices had not risen at all, though it had to pay
up to 30 percent more for the goods and services it bought
from the other producing groups in the community, A, B and
C.</p>
