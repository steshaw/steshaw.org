<p>The case becomes even clearer if we turn from
farming to other forms of business. The proposal is frequently made that the
government ought to assume the risks that are “too great for private
industry.” This means that bureaucrats should be permitted to take risks with
the taxpayers’ money that no one is willing to take with his own.</p>

<p>Such a policy would lead to evils of many different
kinds. It would lead to favoritism: to the making of loans to friends, or in
return for bribes. It would inevitably lead to scandals. It would lead to
recriminations whenever the taxpayers’ money was thrown away on enterprises
that failed. It would increase the demand for socialism: for, it would
properly be asked, if the government is going to bear the risks, why should it
not also get the profits? What justification could there possibly be, in fact,
for asking the taxpayers to take the risks while permitting private capitalists
to keep the profits? (This is precisely, however, as we shall later see, what
we already do in the case of “nonrecourse” government loans to farmers.)</p>

<p>But we shall pass over all these evils for the
moment, and concentrate on just one consequence of loans of this type. This is
that they will waste capital and reduce production. They will throw the
available capital into bad or at best dubious projects. They will throw it into
the hands of persons who are less competent or less trustworthy than those who
would otherwise have got it. For the amount of real capital at any moment (as
distinguished from monetary tokens run off on a printing press) is limited. What
is put into the hands of B cannot be put into the hands of A.</p>

<p>People want to invest their own capital. But they
are cautious. They want to get it back. Most lenders, therefore, investigate
any proposal carefully before they risk their own money in it. They weigh the
prospect of profits against the chances of loss. They may sometimes make
mistakes. But for several reasons they are likely to make fewer mistakes than
government lenders. In the first place, the money is either their own or has
been voluntarily entrusted to them. In the case of government-lending the money
is that of other people, and it has been taken from them, regardless of their
personal wish, in taxes. The private money will be invested only where
repayment with interest or profit is definitely expected. This is a sign that
the persons to whom the money has been lent will be expected to produce things
for the market that people actually want. The government money, on the other
hand, is likely to be lent for some vague general purpose like “creating
employment”; and the more inefficient the work—that is, the greater the volume of
employment it requires in relation to the value of the product— the more highly
thought of the investment is likely to be.</p>

<p>The private lenders, moreover, are selected by a
cruel market test. If they make bad mistakes they lose their money and have no
more money to lend. It is only if they have been successful in the past that
they have more money to lend in the future. Thus private lenders (except the
relatively small proportion that have got their funds through inheritance) are
rigidly selected by a process of survival of the fittest. The government
lenders, on the other hand, are either those who have passed civil service
examinations, and know how to answer hypothetical questions hypothetically, or
they are those who can give the most plausible reasons for making loans and the
most plausible explanations of why it wasn’t their fault that the loans failed.
But the net result remains: private loans will utilize existing resources and
capital far better than government loans. Government loans will waste far more
capital and resources than private loans. Government loans, in short, as
compared with private loans, will reduce production, not increase it.</p>

<p>The proposal for government loans to private
individuals or projects, in brief sees B and forgets A. It sees the people into
whose hands the capital is put; it forgets those who would otherwise have had
it. It sees the project to which capital is granted; it forgets the projects
from which capital is thereby withheld. It sees the immediate benefit to one
group; it overlooks the losses to other groups, and the net loss to the
community as a whole.</p>

<p>The case against government-guaranteed loans and
mortgages to private businesses and persons is almost as strong as, though less
obvious than, the case against direct government loans and mortgages. The
advocates of government-guaranteed mortgages also forget that what is being
lent is ultimately real capital, which is limited in supply, and that they are
helping identified B at the expense of some unidentified A.
Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment
or no down payment whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than
otherwise. They force the general taxpayer to subsidize the bad risks and to
defray the losses. They encourage people to “buy” houses
that they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an
oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily
overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the
buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the
building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion. In brief in the
long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage
malinvestment.</p>
