<p>It is important to notice that the new tariff on sweaters would not raise
American wages. To be sure, it would enable Americans to work <i>in the
sweater industry at</i> approximately the average level of American wages
(for workers of their skill), instead of having to compete in that industry
at the British level of wages. But there would be no increase of American
wages <i>in general </i>as a result of the duty; for as we have seen, there
would be no net increase in the number of jobs provided, no net increase in
the demand for goods, and no increase in labor productivity. Labor
productivity would, in fact, be <i>reduced </i>as a result of the
tariff.</p>

<p>And this brings us to the real effect of a tariff wall. It is not merely
that all its visible gains are offset by less obvious but no less real
losses. It results, in fact, in a net loss to the country. For contrary to
centuries of interested propaganda and disinterested confusion, the tariff
<i>reduces </i>the American level of wages.</p>

<p>Let us observe more clearly how it does this. We have seen that the added
amount which consumers pay for a tariff-protected article leaves them just
that much less with which to buy all other articles. There is here no net
gain to industry as a whole. But as a result of the artificial barrier
erected against foreign goods, American labor, capital and land are
deflected from what they can do more efficiently to what they do less
efficiently. Therefore, as a result of the tariff wall the average
productivity of American labor and capital is reduced.</p>

<p>If we look at it now from the consumer’s point of view, we find that he
can buy less with his money. Because he has to pay more for sweaters and
other protected goods, he can buy less of everything else. The general
purchasing power of his income has therefore been reduced. Whether the net
effect of the tariff is to lower money wages or to raise money prices will
depend upon the monetary policies that are followed. But what is clear is
that the tariff—though it may increase wages above what they would have
been <i>in the protected industries—must </i>on net balance, when <i>all
</i>occupations are considered, <i>reduce real </i>wages—-reduce them,
that is to say, compared with what they otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>Only minds corrupted by generations of misleading propaganda can regard
this conclusion as paradoxical. What other result could we expect from a
policy of deliberately using our resources of capital and manpower in less
efficient ways than we know how to use them? What other result could we
expect from deliberately erecting artificial obstacles to trade and
transportation?</p>

<p>For the erection of tariff walls has the same effect as the erection of
real walls. It is significant that the protectionists habitually use the
language of warfare. They talk of “repelling an invasion” of foreign
products. And the means they suggest in the fiscal field are like those of
the battlefield. The tariff barriers that are put up to repel this invasion
are like the tank traps, trenches and barbed-wire entanglements created to
repel or slow down attempted invasion by a foreign army.</p>

<p>And just as the foreign army is compelled to employ more expensive means
to surmount those obstacles — bigger tanks, mine detectors, engineer corps
to cut wires, ford streams and build bridges—so more expensive and
efficient transportation means must be developed to surmount tariff
obstacles. On the one hand, we try to reduce the cost of transportation
between England and America, or Canada and the United States, by developing
faster and more efficient planes and ships, better roads and bridges, better
locomotives and motor trucks. On the other hand, we offset this investment
in efficient transportation by a tariff that makes it commercially even more
difficult to transport goods than it was before. We make it a dollar cheaper
to ship the sweaters, and then increase the tariff by two dollars to prevent
the sweaters from being shipped. By reducing the freight that can be
profitably carried, we reduce the value of the investment in transport
efficiency.</p>
