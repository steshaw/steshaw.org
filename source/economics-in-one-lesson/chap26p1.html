<p><span class="intro">The first edition</span> of this book
appeared in 1946. It is now, as I write this, thirty-two years
later. How much of the lesson expounded in the previous pages
has been learned in this period?</p>

<p>If we are referring to the politicians—to all those
responsible for formulating and imposing government
policies—practically none of it has been learned. On the
contrary, the policies analyzed in the preceding chapters are
far more deeply established and widespread, not only in the
United States, but in practically every country in the world,
than they were when this book first appeared.</p>

<p>We may take, as the outstanding example, inflation. This is
not only a policy imposed for its own sake, but an inevitable
result of most of the other interventionist policies. It
stands today as the universal symbol of government
intervention everywhere.</p>

<p>The 1946 edition explained the consequences of inflation,
but the inflation then was comparatively mild. True, though
federal government expenditures in 1926 had been less than $3
billion and there was a surplus, by fiscal year 1946
expenditures had risen to $55 billion and there was a deficit
of $16 billion. Yet in fiscal year 1947, with the war ended,
expenditures fell to $35 billion and there was an actual
surplus of nearly $4 billion. By fiscal year 1978, however,
expenditures had soared to <i>$45’ </i>billion and the
deficit to $49 billion.</p>

<p>All this has been accompanied by an enormous increase in
the stock of money—from $113 billion of demand deposits plus
currency outside of banks in 1947, to $357 billion in August
1978. In other words, the active money supply has been more
than tripled in the period.</p>

<p>The effect of this increase in money has been a dramatic
increase in prices. The consumer price index in 1946 stood at
In September1978 it was 199.3. Prices, in short, more than
tripled.<A href="chap28p1.html#12PM"><sup>[12]</sup></A></p>

<p>The policy of inflation, as I have said, is partly imposed
for its own sake. More than forty years after the publication
of John Maynard Keynes’ <i>General Theory, </i>and more than
twenty years after that book has been thoroughly discredited
by analysis and experience, a great number of our politicians
are still unceasingly recommending more deficit spending in
order to cure or reduce existing unemployment. An appalling
irony is that they are making these recommendations when the
federal government has already been running a deficit for
forty-one out of the last forty-eight years and when that
deficit has been reaching dimensions of $50 billion a year. <A
href="chap28p1.html#13PM"><sup>[13]</sup></A></p>

<p>An even greater irony is that, not satisfied with following
such disastrous policies at home, our officials have been
scolding other countries, notably Germany and Japan, for not
following these “expansionary” policies themselves. This
reminds one of nothing so much as Aesop’s fox, who, when he
had lost his tail, urged all his fellow foxes to cut off
theirs.</p>

<p>One of the worst results of the retention of the Keynesian
myths is that it not only promotes greater and greater
inflation, but that it systematically diverts attention from
the real causes of our unemployment, such as excessive union
wage-rates, minimum wage laws, excessive and prolonged
unemployment insurance, and overgenerous relief payments.</p>

<p>But the inflation, though in part often deliberate, is
today mainly the consequence of other government economic
interventions. It is the consequence, in brief, of the
Redistributive State—of all the policies of expropriating
money from Peter in order to lavish it on Paul.</p>

<p>This process would be easier to trace, and its ruinous
effects easier to expose, if it were all done in some single
measure—like the guaranteed annual income actually proposed
and seriously considered by committees of Congress in the
early 1970s. This was a proposal to tax still more ruthlessly
all incomes above average and turn the proceeds over to all
those living below a so-called minimum poverty line, in order
to guarantee them an income— whether they were willing to
work or not—”to enable them to live with dignity.” It
would be hard to imagine a plan more clearly calculated to
discourage work and production and eventually to impoverish
everybody.</p>

<p>But instead of passing any such single measure, and
bringing on ruin in a single swoop, our government has
preferred to enact a hundred laws that effect such a
redistribution on a partial and selective basis. These
measures may miss some needy groups entirely; but on the other
hand they may shower upon other groups a dozen different
varieties of benefits, subsidies, and other handouts. These
include, to give a random list: Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, unemployment insurance, food stamps, veterans’
benefits, farm subsidies, subsidized housing, rent subsidies,
school lunches, public employment on make-work jobs, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children, and direct relief of all
kinds, including aid to the aged, the blind, and the disabled.
The federal government has estimated that under these last
categories it has been handing federal aid benefits to more
than 4 million people—not to count what the states and
cities are doing.</p>

<p>One author has recently counted and examined no fewer than
forty-four welfare programs. Government expenditures for these
in 1976 totaled $187 billion. The combined average growth of
these programs between 1971 and 1976 was 25 percent a
year—2.5 times the rate of growth of estimated gross
national product for the same period. Projected expenditures
for 1979 are more than $250 billion. Coincident with the
extraordinary growth of these welfare expenditures has been
the development of a “national welfare industry,” now
composed of <i>5 </i>million public and private workers
distributing payments and services to 50 million
beneficiaries. <A href="#*"><sup>[*]</sup></a> </p>

<p>Nearly every other Western country has been administering a
similar assortment of aid programs—though sometimes a more
integrated and less haphazard collection. And in order to do
this they have been resorting to more and more Draconian
taxation.</p>

<p>We need merely point to Great Britain as one example. Its
government has been taxing personal income from work
(“earned” income) up to 83 percent, and personal income
from investment (“unearned” income) up to 98 percent.
Should it be surprising that it has discouraged work and
investment and so profoundly discouraged production and
employment? There is no more certain way to deter employment
than to harass and penalize employers. There is no more
certain way to keep wages low than to destroy every incentive
to investment in new and more efficient machines and
equipment. But this is becoming more and more the policy of
governments everywhere. <A
href="chap28p1.html#14PM"><sup>[14]</sup></A></p>

<p>Yet this Draconian taxation has not brought revenues to
keep pace with ever more reckless government spending and
schemes for redistributing wealth. The result has been to
bring chronic and growing government budget deficits, and
therefore chronic and mounting inflation, in nearly every
country in the world.</p>

<p>For the last thirty years or so, Citibank of New York has
been keeping a record of this inflation over ten-year periods.
Its calculations are based on the cost-of-living estimates
published by the individual governments themselves. In its
economic letter of October 1977 it published a survey of
inflation in fifty countries. These figures show that in 1976,
for example, the West German mark, with the best record, had
lost 35 percent of its purchasing power over the preceding ten
years; that the Swiss franc had lost 40 percent, the American
dollar 43 percent, the French franc 50 percent, the Japanese
yen 57 percent, the Swedish krone 47 percent, the Italian lira
56 percent, and the British pound 61 percent. When we get to
Latin America, the Brazilian cruzeiro had lost 89 percent of
its value, and the Uruguayan, Chilean, and Argentine pesos
more than 99 percent.</p>

<p>Though when compared with the record of a year or two
before, the overall record of world currency depreciations was
more moderate; the American dollar in 1977 was depreciating at
an annual rate of 6 percent, the French franc of 8.6 percent,
the Japanese yen of 9.1 percent, the Swedish krone of percent,
the British pound of 14.5 percent, the Italian lira of 15.7
percent, and the Spanish peseta at an annual rate of 17.5
percent. As for Latin American experience, the Brazilian
currency unit in 1977 was depreciating at an annual rate of
30.8 percent, the Uruguayan of 35.5, the Chilean of 53.9, and
the Argentinean of 65.7.<A
href="chap28p1.html#15PM"><sup>[15]</sup></A></p>

<p>I leave it to the reader to picture the chaos that these
rates of depreciation of money were producing in the economies
of these countries and the suffering in the lives of millions
of their inhabitants.</p>

<p>As I have pointed out, these inflations, themselves the
cause of so much human misery, were in turn in large part the
consequence of other policies of government economic
intervention. Practically all these interventions
unintentionally illustrate and underline the basic lesson of
this book. All were enacted on the assumption that they would
confer some immediate benefit on some special group. Those who
enacted them failed to take heed of their secondary
consequences—failed to consider what their effect would be
in the long run on all groups.</p>

<p>In sum, so far as the politicians are concerned, the lesson
that this book tried to instill more than thirty years ago
does not seem to have been learned anywhere.</p>

<p>If we go through the chapters of this book seriatim, we
find practically no form of government intervention deprecated
in the first edition that is not still being pursued, usually
with increased obstinacy. Governments everywhere are still
trying to cure by public works the unemployment brought about
by their own policies. They are imposing heavier and more
expropriatory taxes than ever. They still recommend credit
expansion. Most of them still make “full employment” their
overriding goal. They continue to impose import quotas and
protective tariffs. They try to increase exports by
depreciating their currencies even further. Farmers are still
“striking” for “parity prices.” Governments still
provide special encouragements to unprofitable industries.
They still make efforts to “stabilize” special commodity
prices.</p>

<p>Governments, pushing up commodity prices by inflating their
currencies, continue to blame the higher prices on private
producers, sellers, and “profiteers.” They impose price
ceilings on oil and natural gas, to discourage new exploration
precisely when it is in most need of encouragement, or resort
to general price and wage fixing or “monitoring.” They
continue rent control in the face of the obvious devastation
it has caused. They not only retain minimum wage laws but keep
increasing their level, in face of the chronic unemployment
they so clearly bring about. They continue to pass laws
granting special privileges and immunities to labor unions; to
oblige workers to become members; to tolerate mass picketing
and other forms of coercion; and to compel employers to
“bargain collectively in good faith” with such unions—
i.e., to make at least some concessions to their demands. The
intention of all these measures is to “help labor.” But
the result is once more to create and prolong unemployment,
and to lower total wage payments compared with what they might
have been.</p>

<p>Most politicians continue to ignore the necessity of
profits, to overestimate their average or total net amount, to
denounce unusual profits anywhere, to tax them excessively,
and sometimes even to deplore the very existence of
profits.</p>

<p>The anticapitalistic mentality seems more deeply embedded
than ever. Whenever there is any slowdown in business, the
politicians now see the main cause as “insufficient consumer
spending.” At the same time that they encourage more
consumer spending they pile up further disincentives and
penalties in the way of saving and investment. Their chief
method of doing this today, as we have already seen, is to
embark on or accelerate inflation. The result is that today,
for the first time in history, no nation is on a metallic
standard, and practically every nation is swindling its own
people by printing a chronically depreciating paper
currency.</p>

<p>To pile one more item on this heap, let us examine the
recent tendency, not only in the United States but abroad, for
almost every “social” program, once launched upon, to get
completely out of hand. We have already glanced at the overall
picture, but let us now look more closely at one outstanding
example — Social Security in the United States.</p>

<p>The original federal Social Security Act was passed in
1935. The theory behind it was that the greater part of the
relief problem was that people did not save in their working
years, and so, when they were too old to work, they found
themselves without resources. This problem could be solved, it
was thought, if they were compelled to insure themselves, with
employers also compelled to contribute half the necessary
premiums, so that they would have a pension sufficient to
retire on at age sixty-five or over. Social Security was to be
entirely a self-financed insurance plan based on strict
actuarial principles. A reserve fund was to be set up
sufficient to meet future claims and payments as they fell
due.</p>

<p>It never worked out that way. The reserve fund existed
mainly on paper. The government spent the Social Security tax
receipts, as they came in, either to meet its ordinary
expenses or to pay out benefits. Since 1975, current benefit
payments have exceeded the system’s tax receipts.</p>

<p>It also turned out that in practically every session
Congress found ways to increase the benefits paid, broaden the
coverage, and add new forms of “social insurance.” As one
commentator pointed out in 1965, a few weeks after Medicare
insurance was added: “Social Security sweeteners have been
enacted in each of the past seven general election years.</p>

<p>As inflation developed and progressed, Social Security
benefits were increased not only in proportion, but much more.
The typical political ploy was to load up benefits in the
present and push costs into the future. Yet that future always
arrived; and each few years later Congress would again have to
increase payroll taxes levied on both workers and
employers.</p>

<p>Not only were the tax rates continuously increased, but
there was a constant rise in the amount of salary taxed. In
the original 1935 bill the salary taxed was only the first
$3,000. The early tax rates were very low. But between 1965
and 1977, for example, the Social Security tax shot up from
4.4 percent on the first $6,600 of earned income (levied on
employer and employee alike) to a combined 11.7 percent on the
first $16,500 (Between 1960 and 1977, the total annual tax
increased by 572 percent, or about 12 percent a year
compounded. It is scheduled to go much higher.) At the
beginning of 1977, unfunded liabilities of the Social Security
system were officially estimated at  $4.1 <i>trillion.</i><A
href="chap28p1.html#16PM"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p>No one can say today whether Social Security is really an
insurance program or just a complicated and lopsided relief
system. The bulk of the present benefit recipients are being
assured that they “earned” and “paid for” their
benefits. Yet no private insurance company could have afforded
to pay existing benefit scales out of the “premiums”
actually received. As of early 1978, when low-paid workers
retire, their monthly benefits generally represent about 60
percent of what they earned on the job. Middle-income workers
receive about <i>45 </i>percent. For those with exceptionally
high salaries, the ratio can fall to or 10 percent. If Social
Security is thought of as a relief system, however, it is a
very strange one, for those who have already been getting the
highest salaries receive the highest dollar benefits.</p>

<p>Yet Social Security today is still sacrosanct. It is
considered political suicide for any congressman to suggest
cutting down or cutting back not only present but promised
future benefits. The American Social Security system must
stand today as a frightening symbol of the almost inevitable
tendency of any national relief, redistribution, or
“insurance scheme, once established, to run completely out
of control.</p>

<p>In brief, the main problem we face today is not economic,
but political. Sound economists are in substantial agreement
concerning what ought to be done. Practically all government
attempts to redistribute wealth and income tend to smother
productive incentives and lead toward general impoverishment.
It is the proper sphere of government to create and enforce a
framework of law that prohibits force and fraud. But it must
refrain from specific economic interventions. Government’s
main economic function is to encourage and preserve a free
market. When Alexander the Great visited the philosopher
Diogenes and asked whether he could do anything for him,
Diogenes is said to have replied: ‘Yes, stand a little less
between me and the sun.” It is what every citizen is
entitled to ask of his government.</p>

<p>The outlook is dark, but it is not entirely without hope.
Here and there one can detect a break in the clouds. More and
more people are becoming aware that government has nothing to
give them without first taking it away from somebody else—or
from themselves. Increased handouts to selected groups mean
merely increased taxes, or increased deficits and increased
inflation. And inflation, in the end, misdirects and
disorganizes production. Even a few politicians are beginning
to recognize this, and some of them even to state it
clearly.</p>

<p>In addition, there are marked signs of a shift in the
intellectual winds of doctrine. Keynesians and New Dealers
seem to be in a slow retreat. Conservatives, libertarians, and
other defenders of free enterprise are becoming more outspoken
and more articulate. And there are many more of them. Among
the young, there is a rapid growth of a disciplined school of
“Austrian” economists.</p>

<p>There is a real promise that public policy may be reversed
before the damage from existing measures and trends has become
irreparable.</p>
