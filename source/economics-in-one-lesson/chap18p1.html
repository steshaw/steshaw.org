<p><span class="intro">Government control</span> of the rents
of houses and apartments is a special form of price control.
Most of its consequences are substantially the same as those
of price control in general, but a few call for special
consideration.</p>

<p>Rent controls are sometimes imposed as a part of general
price controls, but more often they are decreed by a special
law. A frequent occasion is the beginning of a war. An army
post is set up in a small town; rooming houses increase rents
for rooms; owners of apartments and houses increase their
rents. This leads to public indignation. Or houses in some
towns may be actually destroyed by bombs, and the need for
armaments or other supplies diverts materials and labor from
the building trades.</p>

<p>Rent control is initially imposed on the argument that the
supply of housing is not “elastic”—i.e., that a housing
shortage cannot be immediately made up, no matter how high
rents are allowed to rise. Therefore, it is contended, the
government, by forbidding increases in rents, protects tenants
from extortion and exploitation without doing any real harm to
landlords and without discouraging new construction.</p>

<p>This argument is defective even on the assumption that the
rent control will not long remain in effect. It overlooks an
immediate consequence. If landlords are allowed to raise rents
to reflect a monetary inflation and the true conditions of
supply and demand, individual tenants will economize by taking
less space. This will allow others to share the accommodations
that are in short supply. The same amount of housing will
shelter more people, until the shortage is relieved.</p>

<p>Rent control, however, encourages wasteful use of space. It
discriminates in favor of those who already occupy houses or
apartments in a particular city or region at the expense of
those who find themselves on the outside. Permitting rents to
rise to the free market level allows all tenants or would-be
tenants equal opportunity to bid for space. Under conditions
of monetary inflation or real housing shortage, rents would
rise just as surely if landlords were not allowed to set an
asking price, but were allowed merely to accept the highest
competitive bids of tenants.</p>

<p>The effects of rent control become worse the longer the
rent control continues. New housing is not built because there
is no incentive to build it. With the increase in building
costs (commonly as a result of inflation), the old level of
rents will not yield a profit. If, as often happens, the
government finally recognizes this and exempts new housing
from rent control, there is still not an incentive to as much
new building as if older buildings were also free of rent
control. Depending on the extent of money depreciation since
old rents were legally frozen, rents for new housing might be
ten or twenty times as high as rent in equivalent space in the
old. (This actually happened in France after World War II, for
example.) Under such conditions existing tenants in old
buildings are indisposed to move, no matter how much their
families grow or their existing accommodations
deteriorate.</p>

<p>Because of low fixed rents in old buildings, the tenants
already in them, and legally protected against rent increases,
are encouraged to use space wastefully, whether or not their
families have grown smaller. This concentrates the immediate
pressure of new demand on the relatively few new buildings. It
tends to force rents in them, at the beginning, to a higher
level than they would have reached in a wholly free
market.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this will not correspondingly encourage the
construction of new housing. Builders or owners of preexisting
apartment houses, finding themselves with restricted profits
or perhaps even losses on their old apartments, will have
little or no capital to put into new construction. In
addition, they, or those with capital from other sources, may
fear that the government may at any time find an excuse for
imposing rent controls even on the new buildings. And it often
does.</p>

<p>The housing situation will deteriorate in other ways. Most
important, unless the appropriate rent increases are allowed,
landlords will not trouble to remodel apartments or make other
improvements in them. In fact, where rent control is
particularly unrealistic or oppressive, landlords will not
even keep rented houses or apartments in tolerable repair. Not
only will they have no economic incentive to do so; they may
not even have the funds. The rent-control laws, among their
other effects, create ill feeling between landlords who are
forced to take minimum returns or even losses, and tenants who
resent the landlord’s failure to make adequate repairs.</p>

<p>A common next step of legislatures, acting under merely
political pressures or confused economic ideas, is to take
rent controls off “luxury” apartments while keeping them
on low or middle-grade apartments. The argument is that the
rich tenants can afford to pay higher rents, but the poor
cannot.</p>

<p>The long-run effect of this discriminatory device, however,
is the exact opposite of what its advocates intend. The
builders and owners of luxury apartments are encouraged and
rewarded; the builders and owners of the more needed low-rent
housing are discouraged and penalized. The former are free to
make as big a profit as the conditions of supply and demand
warrant; the latter are left with no incentive (or even
capital) to build more low-rent housing.</p>

<p>The result is a comparative encouragement to the repair and
remodeling of luxury apartments, and a tendency for what new
private building there is to be diverted to luxury apartments.
But there is no incentive to build new low-income housing, or
even to keep existing low-income housing in good repair. The
accommodations for the low-income groups, therefore, will
deteriorate in quality, and there will be no increase in
quantity. Where the population is increasing, the
deterioration and shortage in low-income housing will grow
worse and worse. It may reach a point where many landlords not
only cease to make any profit but are faced with mounting and
compulsory losses. They may find that they cannot even give
their property away. They may actually abandon their property
and disappear, so they cannot be held liable for taxes. When
owners cease supplying heat and other basic services, the
tenants are compelled to abandon their apartments. Wider and
wider neighborhoods are reduced to slums. In recent years, in
New York City, it has become a common sight to see whole
blocks of abandoned apartments, with windows broken, or
boarded up to prevent further havoc by vandals. Arson becomes
more frequent, and the owners are suspected.</p>

<p>A further effect is the erosion of city revenues, as the
property-value base for such taxes continues to shrink. Cities
go bankrupt, or cannot continue to supply basic services.</p>

<p>When these consequences are so clear that they become
glaring, there is of course no acknowledgment on the part of
the imposers of rent control that they have blundered.
Instead, they denounce the capitalist system. They contend
that private enterprise has “failed” again; that
“private enterprise cannot do the job.” Therefore, they
argue, the State must step in and itself build low-rent
housing.</p>

<p>This has been the almost universal result in every country
that was involved in World War II or imposed rent control in
an effort to offset monetary inflation.</p>

<p>So the government launches on a gigantic housing program
— at the taxpayers’ expense. The houses are rented at a
rate that does not pay back costs of construction and
operation. A typical arrangement is for the government to pay
annual subsidies, either directly to the tenants in lower
rents or to the builders or managers of the State housing.
Whatever the nominal arrangement, the tenants in the buildings
are being subsidized by the rest of the population. They are
having part of their rent paid for them. They are being
selected for favored treatment. The political possibilities of
this favoritism are too clear to need stressing. A pressure
group is built up that believes that the taxpayers owe it
these subsidies as a matter of right. Another all but
irreversible step is taken toward the total Welfare State.</p>

<p>A final irony of rent control is that the more unrealistic,
Draconian, and unjust it is, the more fervid the political
arguments for its continuance. If the legally fixed rents are
on the average 95 percent as high as free market rents would
be, and only minor injustice is being done to landlords, there
is no strong political objection to taking off rent controls,
because tenants will only have to pay increases averaging
about percent. But if the inflation of the currency has been
so great, or the rent-control laws so repressive and
unrealistic, that legally fixed rents are only 10 percent of
what free market rents would be, and gross injustice is being
done to owners and landlords, a great outcry will be raised
about the dreadful evils of removing the controls and forcing
tenants to pay an economic rent. The argument is made that it
would be unspeakably cruel and unreasonable to ask the tenants
to pay so sudden and huge an increase. Even the opponents of
rent control are then disposed to concede that the removal of
controls must be a very cautious, gradual, and prolonged
process. Few of the opponents of rent control, indeed, have
the political courage and economic insight under such
conditions to ask even for this gradual decontrol. In sum, the
more unrealistic and unjust the rent control is, the harder it
is politically to get rid of it. In country after country, a
ruinous rent control has been retained years after other forms
of price control have been abandoned.</p>

<p>The political excuses offered for continuing rent control
pass credibility. The law sometimes provides that the controls
may be lifted when the “vacancy rate” is above a certain
figure. The officials retaining the rent control keep
triumphantly pointing out that the vacancy rate has not yet
reached that figure. Of course not. The very fact that the
legal rents are held so far below market rents artificially
increases the demand for rental space at the same time as it
discourages any increase in supply. So the more unreasonably
low the rent ceilings are held, the more certain it is that
the ‘‘scarcity” of rental houses or apartments will
continue.</p>

<p>The injustice imposed on landlords is flagrant. They are,
to repeat, forced to subsidize the rents paid by their
tenants, often at the cost of great net losses to themselves.
The subsidized tenants may frequently be richer than the
landlord forced to assume part of what would otherwise be his
market rent. The politicians ignore this. Men in other
businesses, who support the imposition or retention of rent
control because their hearts bleed for the tenants, do not go
so far as to suggest that they themselves be asked to assume
part of the tenant subsidy through taxation. The whole burden
falls on the single small class of people wicked enough to
have built or to own rental housing.</p>

<p>Few words carry stronger obloquy than <i>slumlord. </i>And
what is a slumlord? He is not a man who owns expensive
property in fashionable neighborhoods, but one who owns only
rundown property in the slums, where the rents are lowest and
where payment is most dilatory, erratic and undependable. It
is not easy to imagine why (except for natural wickedness) a
man who could afford to own decent rental housing would decide
to become a slumlord instead.</p>

<p>When unreasonable price controls are placed on articles of
immediate consumption, like bread, for example, the bakers can
simply refuse to continue to bake and sell it. A shortage
becomes immediately obvious, and the politicians are compelled
to raise the ceilings or repeal them. But housing is very
durable. It may take several years before tenants begin to
feel the results of the discouragement to new building, and to
ordinary maintenance and repair. It may take even longer
before they realize that the scarcity and deterioration of
housing is directly traceable to rent control. Meanwhile, as
long as landlords are getting any net income whatever above
their taxes and mortgage interest, they seem to have no
alternative but to continue holding and renting their
property. The politicians—remembering that tenants have more
votes than landlords—cynically continue their rent control
long after they have been forced to give up general price
controls.</p>

<p>So we come back to our basic lesson. The pressure for rent
control comes from those who consider only its imagined
short-run benefits to one group in the population. But when we
consider its <i>long-ran </i>effects on <i>everybody,
</i>including the tenants themselves, we recognize that rent
control is not only increasingly futile, but increasingly
destructive the more severe it is, and the longer it remains
in effect.</p>
