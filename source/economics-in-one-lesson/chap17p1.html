<p><span class="intro">We have seen</span> what some of the effects are of
governmental efforts to fix the prices of commodities <i>above </i>the
levels to which free markets would otherwise have carried them. Let us now
look at some of the results of government attempts to hold the prices of
commodities <i>below </i>their natural market levels.</p>

<p>The latter attempt is made in our day by nearly all governments in
wartime. We shall not examine here the wisdom of wartime price-fixing. The
whole economy, in total war, is necessarily dominated by the State, and the
complications that would have to be considered would carry us too far beyond
the main question with which this book is concerned.<A
href="#*"><sup>*</sup></A> But wartime price-fixing, wise or not, is in
almost all countries continued for at least long periods after the war is
over, when the original excuse for starting it has disappeared.</p>

<p>It is the wartime inflation that mainly causes the pressure for
price-fixing. At the time of writing, when practically every country is
inflating, though most of them are at peace, price controls are always
hinted at, even when they are not imposed. Though they are always
economically harmful, if not destructive, they have at least a political
advantage from the standpoint of the officeholders.By implication they put
the blame for higher prices on the greed and rapacity of businessmen,
instead of on the inflationary monetary policies of the officeholders
themselves.</p>

<p>Let us first see what happens when the government tries to keep the price
of a single commodity, or a small group of commodities, below the price that
would be set in a free competitive market.</p>

<p>When the government tries to fix maximum prices for only a few items, it
usually chooses certain basic necessities, on the ground that it is most
essential that the poor be able to obtain these at a “reasonable” cost.
Let us say that the items chosen for this purpose are bread, milk and
meat.</p>

<p>The argument for holding down the price of these goods will run something
like this: If we leave beef (let us say) to the mercies of the free market,
the price will be pushed up by competitive bidding so that only the rich
will get it. People will get beef not in proportion to their need, but only
in proportion to their purchasing power. If we keep the price down, everyone
will get his fair share.</p>

<p>The first thing to be noticed about this argument is that if it is valid
the policy adopted is inconsistent and timorous. For if purchasing power
rather than need determines the distribution of beef at a market price of
$2.25 cents a pound, it would also determine it, though perhaps to a
slightly smaller degree, at, say, a legal “ceiling” price of $1.50 cents
a pound. The purchasing-power-rather-than-need argument, in fact, holds as
long as we charge anything for beef whatever. It would cease to apply only
if beef were given away.</p>

<p>But schemes for maximum price-fixing usually begin as efforts to “keep
the cost of living from rising.” And so their sponsors unconsciously
assume that there is something peculiarly “normal” or sacrosanct about
the market price at the moment from which their control starts. That
starting or previous price is regarded as “reasonable,” and any price
above that as “unreasonable,” regardless of changes in the conditions of
production or demand since that starting price was first established.</p>

<div class =footnote><A NAME="*">* My own conclusion,</A> however, is that,
while some government priorities, allocations or rationing may be
unavoidable, government price-fixing is likely to be especially harmful in
total war. Whereas maximum price-fixing requires rationing to make it work,
even temporarily, the converse is not true.</div>
