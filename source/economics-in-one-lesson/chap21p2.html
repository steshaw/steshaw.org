<p>The argument that labor should receive enough to buy back
the product is merely a special form of the general
“purchasing-power” argument. The workers’ wages, it is correctly enough
contended, are the workers’ purchasing power. But it is just
as true that everyone’s income—the grocer’s, the
landlord’s, the employer’s— is his purchasing power for
buying what others have to sell. And one of the most important
things for which others have to find purchasers is their labor
services.</p>

<p>All this, moreover, has its reverse side. <i>In an exchange
economy everybody’s money income is somebody else’s cost.
</i>Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until
compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an
increase in costs of production. An increase in costs of
production, where the government controls prices and forbids
any price increase, takes the profit from marginal producers,
forces them out of business, and means a shrinkage in
production and a growth in unemployment. Even where a price
increase is possible, the higher price discourages buyers,
shrinks the market, and also leads to unemployment. If a 30
percent increase in hourly wages all around the circle forces
a 30 percent increase in prices, labor can buy no more of the
product than it could at the beginning; and the merry-go-round
must start all over again.</p>

<p>No doubt many will be inclined to dispute the contention
that a 30 percent increase in wages can force as great a
percentage increase in prices. It is true that this result can
follow only in the long run and only if monetary and credit
policy permit it. If money and credit are so inelastic that
they do not increase when wages are forced up (and if we
assume that the higher wages are not justified by existing
labor productivity in dollar terms), then the chief effect of
forcing up wage rates will be to force unemployment.</p>

<p>And it is probable, in that case, that total payrolls, both
in dollar amount and in real purchasing power, will be lower
than before. For a drop in employment (brought about by union
policy and not as a transitional result of technological
advance) necessarily means that fewer goods are being produced
for everyone. And it is unlikely that labor will compensate
for the absolute drop in production by getting a larger
relative share of the production that is left. For Paul H.
Douglas in America and A. C. Pigou in England, the first from
analyzing a great mass of statistics, the second by almost
purely deductive methods, arrived independently at the
conclusion that the elasticity of the demand for labor is
somewhere between 3 and 4. This means, in less technical
language, that “a 1 percent reduction in the real rate of
wage is likely to expand the aggregate demand for labor by <A href="#*">not
less than 3 percent.”<sup>*</sup></A> Or, to put the matter the
other way, “If wages are pushed up above the point of
marginal productivity, the decrease in employment would
normally be from three to four times as great as the <A href="#†">increase
in hourly rates”<sup>†</sup></A> so that the total incomes of
the workers would be reduced correspondingly.</p>

<p>Even if these figures are taken to represent only the
elasticity of the demand for labor revealed in a given period
of the past and not necessarily to forecast that of the
future, they deserve the most serious consideration.</p>
