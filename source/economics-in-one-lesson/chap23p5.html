<p>The more sophisticated advocates of inflation, in brief,
are disingenuous. They do not state their case with complete
candor; and they end by deceiving even themselves. They begin
to talk of paper money, like the more naive inflationists, as
if it were itself a form of wealth that could be created at
will on the printing press. They even solemnly discuss a
“multiplier,” by which every dollar printed and spent by
the government becomes magically the equivalent of several
dollars added to the wealth of the country.</p>

<p>In brief, they divert both the public attention and their
own from the real causes of any existing depression. For the
real causes, most of the time, are maladjustments within the
wage-cost-price structure: maladjustments between wages and
prices, between prices of raw materials and prices of finished
goods, or between one price and another or one wage and
another. At some point these maladjustments have removed the
incentive to produce, or have made it actually impossible for
production to continue; and through the organic
interdependence of our exchange economy, depression spreads.
Not until these maladjustments are corrected can full
production and employment be resumed.</p>

<p>True, inflation may sometimes correct them; but it is a
heady and dangerous method. It makes its corrections not
openly and honestly, but by the use of illusion. Inflation,
indeed, throws a veil of illusion over every economic process.
It confuses and deceives almost everyone, including even those
who suffer by it. We are all accustomed to measuring our
income and wealth in terms of money. The mental habit is so
strong that even professional economists and statisticians
cannot consistently break it. It is not easy to see
relationships always in terms of real goods and real welfare.
Who among us does not feel richer and prouder when he is told
that our national income has doubled (in terms of dollars, of
course) compared with some preinflationary period? Even the
clerk who used to get <i>$75 </i>a week and now gets $120
thinks that he must be in some way better off, though it costs
him twice as much to live as it did when he was getting $75.
He is of course not blind to the rise in the cost of living.
But neither is he as fully aware of his real position as he
would have been if his cost of living had not changed and if
his money salary had been reduced to give him the same reduced
purchasing power that he now has, in spite of his salary
increase, because of higher prices. Inflation is the
autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled
the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of
the people.</p>
