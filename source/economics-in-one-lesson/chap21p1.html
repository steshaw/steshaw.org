<p><span class="intro">Amateur writers</span> on economics are
always asking for “just” prices and “just” wages.
These nebulous conceptions of economic justice come down to us
from medieval times. The classical economists worked out
instead, a different concept—the concept of <i>functional
</i>prices and <i>functional </i>wages. Functional prices are
those that encourage the largest volume of production and the
largest volume of sales. Functional wages are those that tend
to bring about the highest volume of employment and the
largest real payrolls.</p>

<p>The concept of functional wages has been taken over, in a
perverted form, by the Marxists and their unconscious
disciples, the purchasing-power school. Both of these groups
leave to cruder minds the question whether existing wages are
“fair.” The real question, they insist, is whether or not
they will <i>work. </i>And the only wages that will work, they
tell us, the only wages that will prevent an imminent economic
crash, are wages that will enable labor “to buy back the
product it creates.” The Marxist and purchasing-power
schools attribute every depression of the past to a preceding
failure to pay such wages. And at no matter what moment they
speak, they are sure that wages are still not high enough to
buy back the product.</p>

<p>The doctrine has proved particularly effective in the hands
of union leaders. Despairing of their ability to arouse the
altruistic interest of the public or to persuade employers
(wicked by definition) ever to be “fair,” they have seized
upon an argument calculated to appeal to the public’s
selfish motives, and frighten it into forcing employers to
grant union demands.</p>

<p>How are we to know, however, precisely when labor does have
“enough to buy back the product”? Or when it has more than
enough? How are we to determine just what the right sum is? As
the champions of the doctrine do not seem to have made any
real effort to answer such questions, we are obliged to try to
find the answers for ourselves.</p>

<p>Some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers
in each industry should receive enough to buy back the
particular product they make. But they surely cannot mean that
the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back
cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back
mink coats; or that the men in the Ford plant should receive
enough to buy Fords and the men in the Cadillac plant enough
to buy Cadillacs.</p>

<p>It is instructive to recall, however, that the unions in
the automobile industry, in the 1940s, when most of their
members were already in the upper third of the country’s
income receivers, and when their weekly wage, according to
government figures, was already 20 percent higher than the
average wage paid in factories and nearly twice as great as
the average paid in retail trade, were demanding a 30 percent
increase so that they might, according to one of their
spokesmen, “bolster our fast-shrinking ability to absorb the
goods which we have the capacity to produce.”</p>

<p>What, then, of the average factory worker and the average
retail worker? If, under such circumstances, the automobile
workers needed a 30 percent increase to keep the economy from
collapsing, would a mere 30 percent have been enough for the
others? Or would they have required increases of to 160
percent to give them as much per capita purchasing power as
the automobile workers? For let us remember that then as now
enormous differences existed between the average wage levels
of different industries. In 1976, workers in retail trade
averaged weekly earnings of only $113.96, while workers in all
manufacturing averaged $207.60 and those in contract
construction $284.93</p><p

>(We may be sure, if the history of wage bargaining even
<i>within individual unions </i>is any guide, that the
automobile workers, if this last proposal had been made, would
have insisted on the maintenance of their existing
differentials; for the passion for economic equality, among
union members as among the rest of us, is, with the exception
of a few rare philanthropists and saints, a passion for
getting as much as those above us in the economic scale
already get rather than a passion for giving those below us as
much as we ourselves already get. But it is with the logic and
soundness of a particular economic theory, rather than with
these distressing weaknesses of human nature, that we are at
present concerned.)</p>
