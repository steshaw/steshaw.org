<p>Thus we are driven to the conclusion that unions, though
they may for a time be able to secure an increase in money
wages for their members, partly at the expense of employers
and more at the expense of nonunionized workers, <i>cannot, in
the long-run and for the whole body of workers, increase real
wages at all.</i></p>

<p>The belief that they do so rests on a series of delusions.
One of these is the fallacy of <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc,
</i>which sees the enormous rise in wages in the last half
century, due principally to the growth of capital investment
and to scientific and technological advance, and ascribes it
to the unions because the unions were also growing during this
period. But the error most responsible for the delusion is
that of considering merely what a rise of wages brought about
by union demands means in the short run for the particular
workers who retain their jobs, while failing to trace the
effects of this advance on employment, production and the
living costs of all workers, including those who forced the
increase.</p>

<p>One may go further than this conclusion, and raise the
question whether unions have not, in the long run and for the
whole body of workers, actually prevented real wages from
rising to the extent to which they otherwise might have risen.
They have certainly been a force working to hold down or to
reduce wages if their effect, on net balance, has been to
reduce labor productivity; and we may ask whether it has not
been so.</p>

<p>With regard to productivity there is something to be said
for union policies, it is true, on the credit side. In some
trades they have insisted on standards to increase the level
of skill and competence. And in their early history they did
much to protect the health of their members. Where labor was
plentiful, individual employers often stood to make short-run
gains by speeding up workers and working them long hours in
spite of ultimate ill effects upon their health, because they
could easily be replaced with others. And sometimes ignorant
or shortsighted employers might even reduce their own profits
by overworking their employees. In all these cases the unions,
by demanding decent standards, often increased the health and
broader welfare of their members at the same time as they
increased their real wages.</p>

<p>But in recent years, as their power has grown, and as much
misdirected public sympathy has led to a tolerance or
endorsement of antisocial practices, unions have gone beyond
their legitimate goals. It was a gain, not only to health and
welfare, but even in the long run to production, to reduce a
seventy-hour week to a sixty-hour week. It was a gain to
health and leisure to reduce a sixty-hour week to a
forty-eight-hour week. It was a gain to leisure, but not
necessarily to production and income, to reduce a
forty-eight-hour week to a forty-four-hour week. The value to
health and leisure of reducing the working week to forty hours
is much less, the reduction in output and income more clear.
But the unions now talk about, and sometimes enforce,
thirty-five and thirty-hour weeks, and deny that these can or
need reduce output or income.</p>

<p>But it is not only in reducing scheduled working hours that
union policy has worked against productivity. That, in fact,
is one of the least harmful ways in which it has done so; for
the compensating gain, at least, has been clear. But many
unions have insisted on rigid subdivisions of labor which have
raised production costs and led to expensive and ridiculous
“jurisdictional” disputes. They have opposed payment on
the basis of output or efficiency, and insisted on the same
hourly rates for all their members regardless of differences
in productivity. They have insisted on promotion for seniority
rather than for merit. They have initiated deliberate
slowdowns under the pretense of fighting “speed-ups.” They
have denounced, insisted upon the dismissal of, and sometimes
cruelly beaten, men who turned out more work than their
fellows. They have opposed the introduction or improvement of
machinery. They have insisted that if any of their members
have been laid off because of the installation of more
efficient or more laborsaving machinery, the laid-off workers
receive “guaranteed incomes” indefinitely. They have
insisted on make-work rules to require more people or more
time to perform a given task. They have even insisted, with
the threat of ruining employers, on the hiring of people who
are not needed at all.</p>

<p>Most of these policies have been followed under the
assumption that there is just a fixed amount of work to be
done, a definite “job fund” which has to be spread over as
many people and hours as possible so as not to use it up too
soon. This assumption is utterly false. There is actually no
limit to the amount of work to be done. Work creates work.
What A produces constitutes the demand for what B
produces.</p>

<p>But because this false assumption exists, and because the
policies of unions are based on it, their net effect has been
to reduce productivity below what it would otherwise have
been. Their net effect, therefore, in the long run and for all
groups of workers, has been to <i>reduce </i>real wages—that
is, wages in terms of the goods they will buy—below the
level to which they would otherwise have risen. The real cause
for the tremendous increase in real wages in the last century
has been, to repeat, the accumulation of capital and the
enormous technological advance made possible by it.</p>

<p>But this process is not automatic. As a result not only of
bad union but of bad governmental policies, it has, in fact,
in the last decade, come to a halt. If we look only at the
average of gross weekly earnings of private nonagricultural
workers in terms of paper dollars, it is true that they have
risen from $107.73 in 1968 to $189.36 in August 1977. But when
the Bureau of Labor Statistics allows for inflation, when it
translates these earnings into 1967 dollars, to take account
of the increase in consumer prices, it finds that real weekly
earnings actually fell from $103.39 in 1968 to $103.36 in
August 1977. <A

<p>This halt in the rise of real wages has not been a
consequence inherent in the nature of unions. It has been the
result of shortsighted union and government policies. There is
still time to change both of them.</p>
