<p>A nice problem, moreover, will be raised by the relief
program designed to take care of the unemployment caused by
the minimum wage law. By a minimum wage of, say, $2.65 an
hour, we have forbidden anyone to work forty hours in a week
for less than $106.<A
href="chap28p1.html#05PM"><sup>[5]</sup></A> Suppose, now, we
offer only $70 a week on relief. This means that we have
forbidden a man to be usefully employed at, say, $90 a week,
in order that we may support him at $70 a week in idleness. We
have deprived society of the value of his services. We have
deprived the man of the independence and self-respect that
come from self-support, even at a low level, and from
performing wanted work, at the same time as we have lowered
what the man could have received by his own efforts.</p>

<p>These consequences follow as long as the weekly relief
payment is a penny less than $106. Yet the higher we make the
relief payment, the worse we make the situation in other
respects. If we offer $106 for relief, then we offer many men
just as much for not working as for working. Moreover,
whatever the sum we offer for relief, we create a situation in
which everyone is working only for the <i>difference
</i>between his wages and the amount of the relief. If the
relief is $106 a week, for example, workers offered a wage of
$2.75 an hour, or $110 a week, are in fact, as they see it,
being asked to work for only $4 a week—for they can get the
rest without doing anything.</p>

<p>It may be thought that we can escape these consequences by
offering “work relief” instead of “home relief “; but
we merely change the nature of the consequences. Work relief
means that we are paying the beneficiaries more than the open
market would pay them for their efforts. Only part of their
relief-wage is for their efforts, therefore, while the rest is
a disguised dole.</p>

<p>It remains to be pointed out that government make-work is
necessarily inefficient and of questionable utility. The
government has to invent projects that will employ the least
skilled. It cannot start teaching people carpentry, masonry,
and the like, for fear of competing with established skills
and arousing the antagonism of existing unions. I am not
recommending it, but it probably would be less harmful all
around if the government in the first place frankly subsidized
the wages of submarginal workers at the work they were already
doing. Yet this would create political headaches of its
own.</p>

<p>We need not pursue this point further, as it would carry us
into problems not immediately relevant. But the difficulties
and consequences of relief must be kept in mind when we
consider the adoption of minimum wage laws or an <A
href="#*">increase in minimums already fixed
<sup>[*]</sup></A></p>

<p>Before we finish with the topic I should perhaps mention
another argument sometimes put forward for fixing a minimum
wage rate by statute. This is that in an industry in which one
big company enjoys a monopoly, it need not fear competition
and can offer below-market wages. This is a highly improbable
situation. Such a “monopoly” company must offer high wages
when it is formed, in order to attract labor from other
industries. Thereafter it could theoretically fail to increase
wage rates as much as other industries, and so pay
“substandard” wages for that particular specialized skill.
But this would be likely to happen only if that industry (or
company) was sick or shrinking; if it were prosperous or
expanding, it would have to continue to offer high wages to
increase its labor force.</p>

<p>We know as a matter of experience that it is the big
companies —those most often accused of being
monopolies—that pay the highest wages and offer the most
attractive working conditions. It is commonly the small
marginal firms, perhaps suffering from excessive competition,
that offer the lowest wages. But all employers must pay enough
to hold workers or to attract them from each other.</p>

<div class =footnote><A NAME="*">* In 1938,</A> when the
average hourly wage paid in all manufacturing in the United
States was about 63 cents an hour, Congress set a legal
minimum of only 25 cents. In 1945, when the average factory
wage had risen to $1.02 an hour, Congress raised the legal
minimum to 40 cents. In 1949, when the average factory wage
had risen to $1.40 an hour, Congress raised the minimum again
to 75 cents. In 1955, when the average had risen to $i.88,
Congress boosted the minimum to $1. In 1961, with the average
factory wage at about $2.30 an hour, the minimum was raised to
$1.15 in 1961 and to $1.25 for 1963. To shorten the account,
the minimum wage was raised to $1.40 in 1967, to $1.60 in
1968, to $2.00 in 1974, to $2.10 in 1975, and to $2.30 in 1976
(when the average wage in all private nonagricultural work was
$4.87) Then in 1977, when the actual average hourly wage in
nonagricultural work was $5.26, the minimum wage was raised to
$2.65 an hour, with provision made for notching it up still
further in each of the next three years. Thus, as the
prevailing hourly wage goes higher, the minimum wage advocates
decide that the legal minimum must be raised at least
correspondingly. Though the legislation follows the rise of
the prevailing market wage rate, the myth continues to be
built up that it is the minimum wage legislation that has
raised the market wage. <A
