<p>This leads us to the heart of the question. It is usually
assumed that an increase in wages is gained at the expense of
the profits of employers. This may of course happen for short
periods or in special circumstances. If wages are forced up in
a particular firm, in such competition with others that it
cannot raise its prices, the increase will come out of its
profits. This is less likely to happen if the wage increase
takes place throughout a whole industry. If the industry does
not face foreign competition it may be able to increase its
prices and pass the wage increase along to consumers. As these
are likely to consist for the most part of workers, they will
simply have their real wages reduced by having to pay more for
a particular product. It is true that as a result of the
increased prices, sales of that industry’s products may fall
off, so that volume of profits in the industry will be
reduced; but employment and total payrolls in the industry are
likely to be reduced by a corresponding amount.</p>

<p>It is possible, no doubt, to conceive of a case in which
the profits in a whole industry are reduced without any
corresponding reduction in employment—a case, in other
words, in which an increase in wage rates means a
corresponding increase in payrolls, and in which the whole
cost comes out of the industry’s profits without throwing
any firm out of business. Such a result is not likely, but it
is conceivable.</p>

<p>Suppose we take an industry like that of the railroads, for
example, which cannot always pass increased wages along to the
public in the form of higher rates, because government
regulation will not permit it.</p>

<p>It is at least possible for unions to make their gains in
the short run at the expense of employers and investors. The
investors once had liquid funds. But they have put them, say,
into the railroad business. They have turned them into rails
and roadbeds, freight cars and locomotives. Once their capital
might have been turned into any of a thousand forms, but today
it is <i>trapped, </i>so to speak, in one specific form. The
railway unions may force them to accept smaller returns on
this capital already invested. It will pay the investors to
continue running the railroad if they can earn anything at all
above operating expenses, even if it is only one-tenth of one
percent on their investment.</p>

<p>But there is an inevitable corollary of this. If the money
that they have invested in railroads now yields less than
money they can invest in other lines, the investors will not
put a cent more into railroads. They may replace a few of the
things that wear out first, to protect the small yield on
their remaining capital; but in the long run they will not
even bother to replace items that fall into obsolescence or
decay. If capital invested at home pays them less than that
invested abroad, they will invest abroad. If they cannot find
sufficient return anywhere to compensate them for their risk,
they will cease to invest at all.</p>

<p>Thus the exploitation of capital by labor can at best he
merely temporary. It will quickly come to an end. It will come
to an end, actually, not so much in the way indicated in our
hypothetical illustration, as by the forcing of marginal firms
out of business entirely, the growth of unemployment, and the
forced readjustment of wages and profits to the point where
the prospect of normal (or abnormal) profits leads to a
resumption of employment and production. But in the meanwhile,
as a result of the exploitation, unemployment and reduced
production will have made everybody poorer. Even though labor
for a time will have a greater <i>relative </i>share of the
national income, the national income will fall absolutely; so
that labor’s relative gains in these short periods may mean
a Pyrrhic victory: they may mean that labor, too, is getting a
lower total amount in terms of real purchasing power.</p>
