<p>The same reasoning applies to civilian government officials whenever they
are retained in excessive numbers and do not perform services for the
community reasonably equivalent to the remuneration they receive. Yet
whenever any effort is made to cut down the number of unnecessary
officeholders the cry is certain to be raised that this action is
“deflationary.” Would you remove the “purchasing power” from these
officials? Would you injure the landlords and tradesmen who depend on that
purchasing power? You are simply cutting down “the national income” and
helping to bring about or intensify a depression.</p>

<p>Once again the fallacy comes from looking at the effects of this action
only on the dismissed officeholders themselves and on the particular
tradesmen who depend upon them. Once again it is forgotten that, if these
bureaucrats are not retained in office, the taxpayers will be permitted to
keep the money that was formerly taken from them for the support of the
bureaucrats. Once again it is forgotten that the taxpayers’ income and
purchasing power go up by at least as much as the income and purchasing
power of the former officeholders go down. If the particular shopkeepers who
formerly got the business of these bureaucrats lose trade, other shopkeepers
elsewhere gain at least as much. Washington is less prosperous, and can,
perhaps, support fewer stores; but other towns can support more.</p>

<p>Once again, however, the matter does not end there. The country is not
merely as well off without the superfluous officeholders as it would have
been had it retained them. It is much better off. For the officeholders must
now seek private jobs or set up private business. And the added purchasing
power of the taxpayers, as we noted in the case of the soldiers, will
encourage this. But the officeholders can take private jobs only by
supplying equivalent services to those who provide the jobs—or, rather, to
the customers of the employers who provide the jobs. Instead of being
parasites, they become productive men and women.</p>

<p>I must insist again that in all this I am not talking of public
officeholders whose services are really needed. Necessary policemen,
firemen, street cleaners, health officers, judges, legislators and
executives perform productive services as important as those of anyone in
private industry. They make it possible for private industry to function in
an atmosphere of law, order, freedom and peace. But their justification
consists in the utility of their services. It does not consist in the
“purchasing power” they possess by virtue of being on the public
payroll.</p>

<p>This “purchasing power” argument is, when one considers it seriously,
fantastic. It could just as well apply to a racketeer or a thief who robs
you. After he takes your money he has more purchasing power. He supports
with it bars, restaurants, night clubs, tailors, perhaps automobile workers.
But for every job his spending provides, your own spending must provide one
less, because you have that much less to spend. Just so the taxpayers
provide one less job for every job supplied by the spending of
officeholders. When your money is taken by a thief, you get nothing in
return. When your money is taken through taxes to support needless
bureaucrats, precisely the same situation exists. We are lucky, indeed, if
the needless bureaucrats are mere easygoing loafers. They are more likely
today to be energetic reformers busily discouraging and disrupting
production.</p>

<p>When we can find no better argument for the retention of any group of
officeholders than that of retaining their purchasing power it is a sign
that the time has come to get rid of them.</p>
