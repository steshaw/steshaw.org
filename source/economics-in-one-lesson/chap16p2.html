<p>The restrictionists usually reply that this drop in output is what
happens anyway under a market economy. But there is a fundamental
difference, as we have seen in the preceding chapter. In a competitive
market economy it is the high-cost producers, the <i>inefficient
</i>producers, that are driven out by a fall in price. In the case of an
agricultural commodity it is the least competent farmers, or those with the
poorest equipment, or those working the poorest land, that are driven out.
The most capable farmers on the best land do not have to restrict their
production. On the contrary, if the fall in price has been symptomatic of a
lower average cost of production, reflected through an increased supply,
then the driving out of the marginal farmers on the marginal land enables
the good farmers on the good land to <i>expand </i>their production. So
there may be, in the long run, no reduction whatever in the output of that
commodity. And the product is then produced and sold at a <i>permanently
</i>lower price.</p>

<p>If that is the outcome, then the consumers of that commodity will be as
well supplied with it as they were before. But, as a result of the lower
price, they will have money left over, which they did not have before, to
spend on other things. The consumers, therefore, will obviously be better
off. But their increased spending in other directions will give increased
employment in other lines, which will then absorb the former marginal
farmers in occupations in which their efforts will be more lucrative and
more efficient.</p>

<p>A uniform proportional restriction (to return to our government
intervention scheme) means, on the one hand, that the efficient low-cost
producers are not permitted to turn out all the output they can at a low
price. It means, on the other hand, that the inefficient high-cost producers
are artificially kept in business. This increases the average cost of
producing the product. It is being produced less efficiently than otherwise.
The inefficient marginal producer thus artificially kept in that line of
production continues to tie up land, labor and capital that could much more
profitably and efficiently be devoted to other uses.</p>

<p>There is no point in arguing that as a result of the restriction scheme
at least the price of farm products has been raised and “the farmers have
more purchasing power.” They have got it only by taking just that much
purchasing power away from the city buyer. (We have been over all this
ground before in our analysis of parity prices.) To give farmers money for
restricting production, or to give them the same amount of money for an
artificially restricted production, is no different from forcing consumers
or taxpayers to pay people for doing nothing at all. In each case the
beneficiaries of such policies get “purchasing power.” But in each case
someone else loses an exactly equivalent amount. The net loss to the
community is the loss of production, because people are supported for not
producing. Because there is less for everybody, because there is less to go
around, real wages and real incomes must decline either through a fall in
their monetary amount or through higher living costs.</p>

<p>But if an attempt is made to keep up the price of an agricultural
commodity and no artificial restriction of output is imposed, unsold
surpluses of the overpriced commodity continue to pile up until the market
for that product finally collapses to a far greater extent than if the
control program had never been put into effect. Or producers outside the
restriction program, stimulated by the artificial rise in price, expand
their own production enormously. This is what happened in the British
rubber-restriction and the American cotton-restriction programs. In either
case the collapse of prices finally goes to catastrophic lengths that would
never have been reached without the restriction scheme. The plan that
started out so bravely to “stabilize” prices and conditions brings
incomparably greater instability than the free forces of the market could
possibly have brought.</p>

<p>Yet new international commodity controls are constantly being proposed.
<i>This </i>time, we are told, they are going to avoid all the old errors.
This time prices are going to be fixed that are “fair” not only for
producers but for consumers. Producing and consuming nations are going to
agree on just what these fair prices are, because no one will be
unreasonable. Fixed prices will necessarily involve “just” allotments
and allocations for production and consumption as among nations, but only
cynics will anticipate any unseemly international disputes regarding these.
Finally, by the greatest miracle of all, this world of superinternational
controls and coercions is also going to be a world of “free”
international trade!</p>

<p>Just what the government planners mean by free trade in this connection I
am not sure, but we can be sure of some of the things they do not mean. They
do not mean the freedom of ordinary people to buy and sell, lend and borrow,
at whatever prices or rates they like and wherever they find it most
profitable to do so. They do not mean the freedom of the plain citizen to
raise as much of a given crop as he wishes, to come and go at will, to
settle where he pleases, to take his capital and other belongings with him.
They mean, I suspect, the freedom of bureaucrats to settle these matters for
him. And they tell him that if he docilely obeys the bureaucrats he will be
rewarded by a rise in his living standards. But if the planners succeed in
tying up the idea of international cooperation with the idea of increased
State domination and control over economic life, the international controls
of the future seem only too likely to follow the pattern of the past, in
which case the plain man’s living standards will decline with his
liberties.</p>
