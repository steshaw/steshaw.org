<p>Emotional economics has given birth to theories that calm
examination cannot justify. One of these is the idea that
labor is being <i>“under paid”generally. </i>This would be
analogous to the notion that in a free market prices in
general are chronically too low. Another curious but
persistent notion is that the interests of a nation’s
workers are identical with each other, and that an increase in
wages for one union in some obscure way helps all other
workers. Not only is there no truth in this idea; the truth is
that, if a particular union by coercion is able to enforce for
its own members a wage substantially above the real market
worth of their services, it will hurt all other workers as it
hurts other members of the community.</p>

<p>In order to see more clearly how this occurs, let us
imagine a community in which the facts are enormously
simplified arithmetically. Suppose the community consisted of
just half a dozen groups of workers, and that these groups
were originally equal to each other in their total wages and
the market value of their product.</p>

<p>Let us say that these six groups of workers consist of (i)
farm hands, (2) retail store workers, (3) workers in the
clothing trades, <i>(4) </i>coal miners, (5) building workers,
and (6) railway employees. Their wage rates, determined
without any element of coercion, are not necessarily equal;
but whatever they are, let us assign to each of them an
original index number of 100 as a base. Now let us suppose
that each group forms a national union and is able to enforce
its demands in proportion not merely to its economic
productivity but to its political power and strategic
position. Suppose the result is that the farm hands are unable
to raise their wages at all, that the retail store workers are
able to get an increase of 10 percent, the clothing workers of
20 percent, the coal miners of 30 percent, the building trades
of 40 percent, and the railroad employees of 50 percent.</p>

<p>On the assumptions we have made, this will mean that there
has been an <i>average </i>increase in wages of 25 percent.
Now suppose, again for the sake of arithmetical simplicity,
that the price of the product that each group of workers makes
rises by the same percentage as the increase in that group’s
wages. (For several reasons, including the fact that labor
costs do not represent all costs, the price will not quite do
that—certainly not in any short period. But the figures will
nonetheless serve to illustrate the basic principle
involved.)</p>

<p>We shall then have a situation in which the cost of living
has risen by an average of 25 percent. The farm hands, though
they have had no reduction in their money wages, will be
considerably worse off in terms of what they can buy. The
retail store workers, even though they have got an increase in
money wages of 10 percent, will be worse off than before the
race began. Even the workers in the clothing trades, with a
money-wage increase of 20 percent, will be at a disadvantage
compared with their previous position. The coal miners, with a
money-wage increase of 30 percent, will have made in
purchasing power only a slight gain. The building and railroad
workers will of course have made a gain, but one much smaller
in actuality than in appearance.</p>

<p>But even such calculations rest on the assumption that the
forced increase in wages has brought about no unemployment.
This is likely to be true only if the increase in wages has
been accompanied by an equivalent increase in money and bank
credit; and even then it is improbable that such distortions
in wage rates can be brought about without creating areas of
unemployment, particularly in the trades in which wages have
advanced the most. If this corresponding monetary inflation
does not occur, the forced wage advances will bring about
widespread unemployment.</p>

<p>The unemployment need not necessarily be greatest, in
percentage terms, among the unions whose wages have been
advanced the most; for unemployment will be shifted and
distributed in relation to the relative elasticity of the
demand for different kinds of labor and in relation to the
“joint” nature of the demand for many kinds of labor. Yet
when all these allowances have been made, even the groups
whose wages have been advanced the most will probably be
found, when their unemployed are averaged with their employed
members, to be worse off than before. And in terms of
<i>welfare, </i>of course, the loss suffered will be much
greater than the loss in merely arithmetical terms, because
the psychological losses of those who are unemployed will
greatly outweigh the psychological gains of those with a
slightly higher income in terms of purchasing power.</p>

<p>Nor can the situation be rectified by providing
unemployment relief. Such relief, in the first place, is paid
for in large part, directly or indirectly, out of the wages of
those who work. It therefore reduces these wages.
“Adequate” relief payments, moreover, as we have already
seen, <i>create </i>unemployment. They do so in several ways.
When strong labor unions in the past made it their function to
provide for their own unemployed members, they thought twice
before demanding a wage that would cause heavy unemployment.
But where there is a relief system under which the general
taxpayer is forced to provide for the unemployment caused by
excessive wage rates, this restraint on excessive union
demands is removed. Moreover, as we have already noted,
“adequate” relief will cause some men not to seek work at
all, and will cause others to consider that they are in effect
being asked to work not for the wage offered, but only for the
<i>difference </i>between that wage and the relief payment.
And heavy unemployment means that fewer goods are produced,
that the nation is poorer, and that there is less for
everybody.</p>

<p>The apostles of salvation by unionism sometimes attempt
another answer to the problem I have just presented. It may be
true, they will admit, that the members of strong unions today
exploit among others, the nonunionized workers; but the remedy
is simple: unionize everybody. The remedy, however, is not
quite that simple. In the first place, in spite of the
enormous legal and political encouragements (one might in some
cases say compulsions) to unionization under the
Wagner-Taft-Hartley Act and other laws, it is not an accident
that only about a fourth of this nation’s gainfully employed
workers are unionized.<A
href="chap28p1.html#07PM"><sup>7</sup></A>The conditions
propitious to unionization are much more special than
generally recognized. But even if universal unionization could
be achieved, the unions could not possibly be equally
powerful, any more than they are today. Some groups of workers
are in a far better strategic position than others, either
because of greater numbers, of the more essential nature of
the product they make, of the greater dependence on their
industry of other industries, or of their greater ability to
use coercive methods. But suppose this were not so? Suppose,
in spite of the self-contradictoriness of the assumption, that
all workers by coercive methods could raise their money wages
by an equal percentage? Nobody would be any better off in the
long run, than if wages had not been raised at all.</p>
