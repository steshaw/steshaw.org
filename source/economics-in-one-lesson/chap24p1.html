<p><span class="intro">From time immemorial</span> proverbial
wisdom has taught the virtues of saving, and warned against
the consequences of prodigality and waste. This proverbial
wisdom has reflected the common ethical as well as the merely
prudential judgments of mankind. But there have always been
squanderers, and there have apparently always been theorists
to rationalize their squandering.</p>

<p>The classical economists, refuting the fallacies of their
own day, showed that the saving policy that was in the best
interests of the individual was also in the best interests of
the nation. They showed that the rational saver, in ma king
provision for his future, was not hurting, but helping, the
whole community. But today the ancient virtue of thrift, as
well as its defense by the classical economists, is once more
under attack, for allegedly new reasons, while the opposite
doctrine of spending is in fashion.</p>

<p>In order to make the fundamental issue as clear as
possible, we cannot do better, I think, than to start with the
classic example used by Bastiat. Let us imagine two brothers,
then, one a spendthrift and the other a prudent man, each of
whom has inherited a sum to yield him an income of $50,000 a
year. We shall disregard the income tax, and the question
whether both brothers really ought to work for a living or
give most of their income to charity, because such questions
are irrelevant to our present purpose.</p>

<p>Alvin, then, the first brother, is a lavish spender. He
spends not only by temperament, but on principle. He is a
disciple (to go no further back) of Rodbertus, who declared in
the middle of the nineteenth century that capitalists “must
expend their income to the last penny in comforts and
luxuries,” for if they <A href="#*">“determine to save...
goods accumulate, and part of the workmen will have no
work.”<sup>[*]</sup></a> Alvin is always seen at the night
clubs; he tips handsomely; he maintains a pretentious
establishment, with plenty of servants; he has a couple of
chauffeurs, and doesn’t stint himself in the number of cars
he owns; he keeps a racing stable; he runs a yacht; he
travels; he loads his wife down with diamond bracelets and fur
coats; he gives expensive and useless presents to his
friends.</p>

<p>To do all this he has to dig into his capital. But what of
it? If saving is a sin, dissaving must be a virtue; and in any
case he is simply making up for the harm being done by the
saving of his pinchpenny brother Benjamin.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that Alvin is a great favorite with
the hat check girls, the waiters, the restaurateurs, the
furriers, the jewelers, the luxury establishments of all
kinds. They regard him as a public benefactor. Certainly it is
obvious to everyone that he is giving employment and spreading
his money around.</p>

<p>Compared with him brother Benjamin is much less popular. He
is seldom seen at the jewelers, the furriers or the night
clubs, and he does not call the head waiters by their first
names. Whereas Alvin spends not only the full $50,000 income
each year but is digging into capital besides, Benjamin lives
much more modestly and spends only about $25,000 Obviously,
think the people who see only what hits them in the eye, he is
providing less than half as much employment as Alvin, and the
other $25,000 is as useless as if it did not exist.</p>

<p>But let us see what Benjamin actually does with this other
$25,000 He does not let it pile up in his pocketbook, his
bureau drawers, or in his safe. He either deposits it in a
bank or he invests it. If he puts it either into a commercial
or a savings bank, the bank either lends it to going
businesses on short term for working capital, or uses it to
buy securities. In other words, Benjamin invests his money
either directly or indirectly. But when money is invested it
is used to buy or build capital goods—houses or office
buildings or factories or ships or trucks or machines. Any one
of these projects puts as much money into circulation and
gives as much employment as the same amount of money spent
directly on consumption.</p>

<p><i>“Saving,” in short, in the modem world, is only
another form of spending. </i>The usual difference is that the
money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to
increase production. So far as giving employment is concerned,
Benjamin’s “saving” and spending combined give as much
as Alvin’s spending alone, and put as much money in
circulation. The chief difference is that the employment
provided by Alvin’s spending can be seen by anyone with one
eye; but it is necessary to look a little more carefully, and
to think a moment, to recognize that every dollar of
Benjamin’s saving gives as much employment as every dollar
that Alvin throws around.</p>

<p>A dozen years roll by. Alvin is broke. He is no longer seen
in the night clubs and at the fashionable shops; and those
whom he formerly patronized, when they speak of him, refer to
him as something of a fool. He writes begging letters to
Benjamin. And Benjamin, who continues about the same ratio of
spending to saving, not only provides more jobs than ever,
because his income, through investment, has grown, but through
his investment he has helped to provide better-paying and more
productive jobs. His capital wealth and income are greater. He
has, in brief, added to the nation’s productive capacity;
Alvin has not.</p>
