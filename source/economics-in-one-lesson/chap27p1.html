<p><span class="intro">Those who desire</span> to read further
in economics should turn next to some work of intermediate
length and difficulty. I know of no single volume in print
today that completely meets this need, but there are several
that together supply it. There is an excellent short book (126
pages) by Faustino Ballvé, <i>Essentials of Economics
</i>(Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic
Education), which briefly summarizes principles and policies.
A book that does that at somewhat greater length (327 pages)
is <i>Understanding the Dollar Crisis </i>by Percy L. Greaves
(Belmont, Mass.: Western Islands, 1973). Bettina Bien Greaves
has assembled two volumes of readings on <i>Free Market
Economics </i>(Foundation for Economic Education).</p>

<p>The reader who aims at a thorough understanding, and feels
prepared for it, should next read <i>Human Action </i>by
Ludwig von Mises (Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1949, 1966, 907
pages). This book extended the logical unity and precision of
economics beyond that of any previous work. A two-volume work
written thirteen years after <i>Human Action </i>by a student
of Mises is Murray Rothbard’s <i>Man, Economy, and State
</i>(Mission, Kan.: Sheed, Andrews and McMeel, 1962, 987
pages). This contains much original and penetrating material;
its exposition is admirably lucid; and its arrangement makes
it in some respects more suitable for textbook use than
Mises’ great work.</p>

<p>Short books that discuss special economic subjects in a
simple way are <i>Planning for Freedom </i>by Ludwig von Mises
(South Holland, Ill.: Libertarian Press, 1952), and
<i>Capitalism and Freedom </i>by Milton Friedman (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1962). There is an excellent
pamphlet by Murray N. Rothbard, <i>What Has</i><i>Government
Done to Our Money? </i>(Santa Ana, Calif.: Rampart College,
1964, <b>1974, </b>62 pages). On the urgent subject of
inflation, a book by the present author has recently been
published, <i>The Inflation Crisis, and How to Resolve It
</i>(New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1978).</p>

<p>Among recent works which discuss current ideologies and
developments from a point of view similar to that of this
volume are the present author’s <i>The Failure of the “New
Economics”: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies
</i>(Arlington House, <b>1959); </b>F. A. Hayek, <i>The Road
to Serfdom </i><b>(1945) </b>and the same author’s
monumental <i>Constitution of Liberty </i>(Chicago: University
of Chicago Press, 1960). Ludwig von Mises’ <i>Socialism: An
Economic and Sociological Analysis </i>(London: Jonathan Cape,
1936, 1969) is the most thorough and devastating critique of
collectivistic doctrines ever written.</p>

<p>The reader should not overlook, of course, Frederic
Bastiat’s <i>Economic Sophisms (ca. </i><b>1844), </b>and
particularly his essay on “What Is Seen and What Is Not
Seen.”</p>

<p>Those who are interested in working through the economic
classics might find it most profitable to do this in the
reverse of their historical order. Presented in this order,
the chief works to be consulted, with the dates of their first
editions, are: Philip Wick-steed, <i>The Common Sense of
Political Economy, </i><b>1911; </b>John Bates Clark, <i>The
Distribution of Wealth, </i>1899; Eugen von BohmBawerk, The
Positive Theory of Capital, 1888; Karl Menger, <i>Principles
of Economics, </i><b>1871; </b>W. Stanley Jevons, <i>The
Theory of Political Economy, </i><b>1871; </b>John Stuart
Mill, <i>Principles of Political Economy, </i>1848; David
Ricardo, <i>Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,
</i><b>1817; </b>and Adam Smith, <i>The Wealth of Nations,
</i>1776.</p>

<p>Economics broadens out in a hundred directions. Whole
libraries have been written on specialized fields alone, such
as money and banking, foreign trade and foreign exchange,
taxation and public finance, government control, capitalism
and socialism, wages and labor relations, interest and
capital, agricultural economics, rent, prices, profits,
markets, competition and monopoly, value and utility,
statistics, business cycles, wealth and poverty, social
insurance, housing, public utilities, mathematical economics,
studies of special industries and of economic history. But no
one will ever properly understand any of these specialized
fields unless he has first of all acquired a firm grasp of
basic economic principles and the complex interrelationship of
all economic factors and forces. When he has done this by his
reading in general economics, he can be trusted to find the
right books in his special field of interest.</p>
