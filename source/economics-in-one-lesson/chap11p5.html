<p>The tariff has been described as a means of benefiting the producer at
the expense of the consumer. In a sense this is correct. Those who favor it
think only of the interests of the producers immediately benefited by the
particular duties involved. They forget the interests of the consumers who
are immediately injured by being forced to pay these duties. But it is wrong
to think of the tariff issue as if it represented a conflict between the
interests of producers as a unit against those of consumers as a unit. It is
true that the tariff hurts all consumers as such. It is not true that it
benefits all producers as such. On the contrary, as we have just seen, it
helps the protected producers at the expense of all other American
producers, <i>and particularly of those who have a comparatively large
potential export market.</i></p>

<p>We can perhaps make this last point clearer by an exaggerated example.
Suppose we make our tariff wall so high that it becomes absolutely
prohibitive, and no imports come in from the outside world at all. Suppose,
as a result of this, that the price of sweaters in America goes up only $5.
Then American consumers, because they have to pay $5 more for a sweater,
will spend on the average five cents less in each of a hundred other
American industries. (The figures are chosen merely to illustrate a
principle: there will, of course, be no such symmetrical distribution of the
loss; moreover, the sweater industry itself will doubtless be hurt because
of protection of still <i>other </i>industries. But these complications may
be put aside for the moment.)</p>

<p>Now because foreign industries will find their market in America
<i>totally </i>cut off, they will get no dollar exchange, and therefore they
will be <i>unable to buy any American goods at all. </i>As a result of this,
American industries will suffer in direct proportion to the percentage of
their sales previously made abroad. Those that will be most injured, in the
first instance, will be such industries as raw cotton producers, copper
producers, makers of sewing machines, agricultural machinery, typewriters,
commercial airplanes, and so on.</p>

<p>A higher tariff wall, which, however, is not prohibitive, will produce
the same kind of results as this, but merely to a smaller degree.</p>

<p>The effect of a tariff, therefore, is to change the <i>structure </i>of
American production. It changes the number of occupations, the kind of
occupations, and the relative size of one industry as compared with another.
It makes the industries in which we are comparatively inefficient larger,
and the industries in which we are comparatively efficient smaller. Its net
effect, therefore, is to reduce American efficiency, as well as to reduce
efficiency in the countries with which we would otherwise have traded more
largely.</p>

<p>In the long run, notwithstanding the mountains of argument pro and con, a
tariff is irrelevant to the question of employment. (True, sudden <i>changes
</i>in the tariff, either upward or downward, can create temporary
unemployment, as they force corresponding changes in the structure of
production. Such sudden changes can even cause a depression.) But a tariff
is not irrelevant to the question of wages. In the long run it always
reduces real wages, because it reduces efficiency, production and
wealth.</p>

<p>Thus all the chief tariff fallacies stem from the central fallacy with
which this book is concerned. They are the result of looking only at the
immediate effects of a single tariff rate on one group of producers, and
forgetting the long-run effects both on consumers as a whole and on all
other producers.</p>

<p>(I hear some reader asking: “Why not solve this by giving tariff
protection to <i>all </i>producers?” But the fallacy here is that this
cannot help producers uniformly, and cannot help at all domestic producers
who already “outsell” foreign producers: these efficient producers must
necessarily suffer from the diversion of purchasing power brought about by
the tariff.)</p>
