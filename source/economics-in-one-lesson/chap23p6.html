<p>And this is precisely its political function. It is because
inflation confuses everything that it is so consistently
resorted to by our modern “planned economy” governments.
We saw in chapter four, to take but one example, that the
belief that public works necessarily create new jobs is false.
If the money was raised by taxation, we saw, then for every
dollar that the government spent on public works one less
dollar was spent by the taxpayers to meet their own wants, and
for every public job created one private job was
destroyed.</p>

<p>But suppose the public works are not paid for from the
proceeds of taxation? Suppose they are paid for by deficit
financing—that is, from the proceeds of government borrowing
or from resort to the printing press? Then the result just
described does not seem to take place. The public works seem
to be created out of “new” purchasing power. You cannot
say that the purchasing power has been taken away from the
taxpayers. For the moment the nation seems to have got
something for nothing.</p>

<p>But now, in accordance with our lesson, let us look at the
longer consequences. The borrowing must some day be repaid.
The government cannot keep piling up debt indefinitely; for if
it tries, it will some day become bankrupt. As Adam Smith
observed in 1776:</p>

	<blockquote> <p>When national debts have once been
	accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I
	believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and
	completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if
	it has even been brought about at all, has always been
	brought about by a bankruptcy; sometimes by an avowed one,
	but always by a real one, though frequently by a pretended
	payment.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Yet when the government comes to repay the debt it has
accumulated for public works, it must necessarily tax more
heavily than it spends. In this later period, therefore, it
must necessarily destroy more jobs than it creates. The
extra-heavy taxation then required does not merely take away
purchasing power; it also lowers or destroys incentives to
production, and so reduces the total wealth and income of the
country.</p>

<p>The only escape from this conclusion is to assume (as of
course the apostles of spending always do) that the
politicians in power will spend money only in what would
otherwise have been depressed or “deflationary” periods,
and will promptly pay the debt off in what would otherwise
have been boom or “inflationary” periods. This is a
beguiling fiction, but unfortunately the politicians in power
have never acted that way. Economic forecasting, moreover, is
so precarious, and the political pressures at work are of such
a nature, that governments are unlikely ever to act that way.
Deficit spending, once embarked upon, creates powerful vested
interests which demand its continuance under all
conditions.</p>

<p>If no honest attempt is made to pay off the accumulated
debt, and resort is had to outright inflation instead, then
the results follow that we have already described. For the
country as a whole cannot get anything without paying for it.
Inflation itself is a form of taxation. It is perhaps the
worst possible form, which usually bears hardest on those
least able to pay. On the assumption that inflation affected
everyone and everything evenly (which, we have seen, is never
true), it would be tantamount to a flat sales tax of the same
percentage on all commodities, with the rate as high on bread
and milk as on diamonds and furs. Or it might be thought of as
equivalent to a flat tax of the same percentage, without
exemptions, on everyone’s income. It is a tax not only on
every individual’s expenditures, but on his savings account
and life insurance. It is, in fact, a flat capital levy,
without exemptions, in which the poor man pays as high a
percentage as the rich man.</p>

<p>But the situation is even worse than this, because, as we
have seen, inflation does not and cannot affect everyone
evenly. Some suffer more than others. The poor are usually
more heavily taxed by inflation, in percentage terms, than the
rich, for they do not have the same means of protecting
themselves by speculative purchases of real equities.
Inflation is a kind of tax that is out of control of the tax
authorities. It strikes wantonly in all directions. The rate
of tax imposed by inflation is not a fixed one: it cannot be
determined in advance. We know what it is today; we do not
know what it will be tomorrow; and tomorrow we shall not know
what it will be on the day after.</p>

<p>Like every other tax, inflation acts to determine the
individual and business policies we are all forced to follow.
It discourages all prudence and thrift. It encourages
squandering, gambling, reckless waste of all kinds. It often
makes it more profitable to speculate than to produce. It
tears apart the whole fabric of stable economic relationships.
Its inexcusable injustices drive men toward desperate
remedies. It plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It
leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably
in bitter disillusion and collapse.</p>
