<p><span class="intro">We have already</span> seen some of the
harmful results of arbitrary governmental efforts to raise the
price of favored commodities. The same sort of harmful results
follow efforts to raise wages through minimum wage laws. This
ought not to be surprising, for a wage is, in fact, a price.
It is unfortunate for clarity of economic thinking that the
price of labor’s services should have received an entirely
different name from other prices. This has prevented most
people from recognizing that the same principles govern
both.</p>

<p>Thinking has become so emotional and so politically biased
on the subject of wages that in most discussions of them the
plainest principles are ignored. People who would be among the
first to deny that prosperity could be brought about by
artificially boosting prices, people who would be among the
first to point out that minimum price laws might be most
harmful to the very industries they were designed to help,
will nevertheless advocate minimum wage laws, and denounce
opponents of them, without misgivings.</p>

<p>Yet it ought to be clear that a minimum wage law is, at
best, a limited weapon for combatting the evil of low wages,
and that the possible good to be achieved by such a law can
exceed the possible harm only in proportion as its aims are
modest. The more ambitious such a law is, the larger the
number of workers it attempts to cover, and the more it
attempts to raise their wages, the more certain are its
harmful effects to exceed any possible good effects.</p>

<p>The first thing that happens, for example, when a law is
passed that no one shall be paid less than $106 for a
forty-hour week is that no one who is not worth $106 a week to
an employer will be employed at all. You cannot make a man
worth a given amount by making it illegal for anyone to offer
him anything less. You merely deprive him of the right to earn
the amount that his abilities and situation would permit him
to earn, while you deprive the community even of the moderate
services that he is capable of rendering. In brief, for a low
wage you substitute unemployment. You do harm all around, with
no comparable compensation.</p>

<p>The only exception to this occurs when a group of workers
is receiving a wage actually below its market worth. This is
likely to happen only in rare and special circumstances or
localities where competitive forces do not operate freely or
adequately; but nearly all these special cases could be
remedied just as effectively, more flexibly and with far less
potential harm, by unionization.</p>

<p>It may be thought that if the law forces the payment of a
higher wage in a given industry, that industry can then charge
higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying
the higher wage is merely shifted to consumers. Such shifts,
however, are not easily made, nor are the consequences of
artificial wage-raising so easily escaped. A higher price for
the product may not be possible: it may merely drive consumers
to the equivalent imported products or to some substitute. Or,
if consumers continue to buy the product of the industry in
which wages have been raised, the higher price will cause them
to buy less of it. While some workers in the industry may be
benefited from the higher wage, therefore, others will be
thrown out of employment altogether. On the other hand, if the
price of the product is not raised, marginal producers in the
industry will be driven out of business; so that reduced
production and consequent unemployment will merely be brought
about in another way.</p>

<p>When such consequences are pointed out, there are those who
reply: “Very well; if it is true that the X industry cannot
exist except by paying starvation wages, then it will be just
as well if the minimum wage puts it out of existence
altogether.” But this brave pronouncement overlooks the
realities. It overlooks, first of all, that consumers will
suffer the loss of that product. It forgets, in the second
place, that it is merely condemning the people who worked in
that industry to unemployment. And it ignores, finally, that
bad as were the wages paid in the X industry, they were the
best among all the alternatives that seemed open to the
workers in that industry; otherwise the workers would have
gone into another. If, therefore, the X industry is driven out
of existence by a minimum wage law, then the workers
previously employed in that industry will be forced to turn to
alternative courses that seemed less attractive to them in the
first place. Their competition for jobs will drive down the
pay offered even in these alternative occupations. There is no
escape from the conclusion that the minimum wage will increase
unemployment.</p>
