<p>AMONG THE MOST viable of all economic delusions is
the belief that machines on net balance create unemployment. Destroyed a
thousand times, it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and
vigorous as ever. Whenever there is long-continued mass unemployment, machines
get the blame anew. This fallacy is still the basis of many labor union
practices. The public tolerates these practices because it either believes at
bottom that the unions are right, or is too confused to see just why they are wrong.</p>

<p>The belief that machines cause unemployment, when
held with any logical consistency, leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only
must we be causing unemployment with every technological improvement we make
today, but primitive man must have started causing it with the first efforts he
made to save himself from needless toil and sweat.</p>

<p>To go no further back, let us turn to Adam Smith’s <i>Wealth of Nations, </i>published in 1776.
The first chapter of this remarkable book is called “Of the Division of Labor,”
and on the second page of this first chapter the author tells us that a workman
unacquainted with the use of machinery employed in pin-making “could scarce
make one pin a day, and certainly could not make twenty,” but with the use of
this machinery he can make 4,800 pins a day. So already, alas, in Adam Smith’s
time, machinery had thrown from 240 to 4,800 pin-makers out of work for every
one it kept. In the pin-making industry there was already, if machines merely
throw men out of jobs, 99.98 percent unemployment. Could things be blacker?</p>

<p>Things could be blacker, for the Industrial
Revolution was just in its infancy. Let us look at some of the incidents and
aspects of that revolution. Let us see, for example, what happened in the
stocking industry. New stocking frames as they were introduced were destroyed
by the handicraft workmen (over 1000 in a single riot), houses were burned,
the inventors were threatened and obliged to flee for their lives, and order
was not finally restored until the military had been called out and the leading
rioters had been either transported or hanged.</p>

<p>Now it is important to bear in mind that insofar as the rioters were
thinking of their own immediate or even longer futures their opposition to
the machine was rational. For William Felkin, in his <i>History of the
Machine-Wrought Hosiery Manufactures </i>(1867), tells us (though the
statement seems implausible) that the larger part of the 50,000 English
stocking knitters and their families did not fully emerge from the hunger
and misery entailed by the introduction of the machine for the next forty
years. But insofar as the rioters believed, as most of them undoubtedly did,
that the machine was permanently displacing men, they were mistaken, for
before the end of the nineteenth century the stocking industry was employing
at least a hundred men for every man it employed at the beginning of the
century.</p>

<p>Arkwright invented his cotton-spinning machinery in
1760. At that time it was estimated that there were in England 5,200 spinners
using spinning wheels, and 2,700 weavers—in all, 7,900 persons engaged in the
production of cotton textiles. The introduction of Arkwright’s invention was
opposed on the ground that it threatened the livelihood of the workers, and the
opposition had to be put down by force. Yet in 1787—twenty-seven years after
the invention appeared—a parliamentary inquiry showed that the number of
persons actually engaged in the spinning and weaving of cotton had risen from
7,900 to 320,000, an increase of 4,400 percent.</p>

<p>If the reader will consult such a book as <i>Recent Economic Changes,
</i>by David A. Wells, published in 1889, he will find passages that, except
for the dates and absolute amounts involved, might have been written by our
technophobes of today. Let me quote a few:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the ten years from 1870 to 1880, inclusive,
the British mercantile marine increased its movement, in the matter of foreign
entries and clearances alone, to the extent of 22,000,000 tons... yet the
number of men who were employed in effecting this great movement had decreased
in 1880, as compared with 1870, to the extent of about three thousand (2,990
exactly). What did it? The introduction of steam-hoisting machines and grain
elevators upon the wharves and docks, the employment of steam power, etc....</p>

<p>In 1873 Bessemer steel in
England, where its price had not been enhanced by protective duties, commanded
$80 per ton; in 1886 it was profitably manufactured and sold in the same
country for less than $20 per ton. Within the same time the annual production
capacity of a Bessemer converter has been increased fourfold, with no increase
but rather a diminution of the involved labor.</p>

<p>The power capacity already
being exerted by the steam engines of the world in existence and working in the
year 1887 has been estimated by the Bureau of Statistics at Berlin as
equivalent to that of 200,000,000 horses, representing approximately 1,000,000,000 
men; or at least three times the working population of the earth....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One would think that this last figure would have
caused Mr. Wells to pause, and wonder why there was any employment left in the
world of 1889 at all; but he merely concluded, with restrained pessimism, that
“under such circumstances industrial overproduction . . . may become
chronic.”</p>

<p>In the depression of 1932, the game of blaming
unemployment on the machines started all over again. Within a few months the
doctrines of a group calling themselves the Technocrats had spread through the
country like a forest fire. I shall not weary the reader with a recital of the
fantastic figures put forward by this group or with corrections to show what
the real facts were. It is enough to say that the Technocrats returned to the
error in all its native purity that machines permanently displace men—except
that, in their ignorance, they presented this error as a new and revolutionary
discovery of their own. It was simply one more illustration
of Santayana’s aphorism that those who cannot remember the past are condemned
to repeat it.</p>

<p>The Technocrats were finally laughed out of
existence; but their doctrine, which preceded them, lingers on. It is reflected
in hundreds of make-work rules and featherbed practices by labor unions; and
these rules and practices are tolerated and even approved because of the
confusion on this point in the public mind.</p>

<p>Testifying on behalf of the United States Department of Justice before
the Temporary National Economic Committee (better known as the TNEC) in
March 1941, Corwin Edwards cited innumerable examples of such practices. The
electrical union in New York City was charged with refusal to install
electrical equipment made outside of New York State unless the equipment was
disassembled and reassembled at the job site. In Houston, Texas, master
plumbers and the plumbing union agreed that piping prefabricated for
installation would be installed by the union only if the thread were cut off
one end of the pipe and new thread were cut at the job site. Various locals
of the painters’ union imposed restrictions on the use of sprayguns,
restrictions in many cases designed merely to make work by requiring the
slower process of applying paint with a brush. A local of the teamsters’
union required that every truck entering the New York metropolitan area have
a local driver in addition to the driver already employed. In various cities
the electrical union required that if any temporary light or power was to be
used on a construction job there must be a full-time maintenance
electrician, who should not be permitted to do any electrical construction
work. This rule, according to Mr. Edwards, “often involves the hiring of a
man who spends his day reading or playing solitaire and does nothing except
throw a switch at the beginning and end of the day.”</p>

<p>One could go on to cite such make-work practices in many other fields. In
the railroad industry, the unions insist that firemen be employed on types
of locomotives that do not need them. In the theaters unions insist on the
use of scene shifters even in plays in which no scenery is used. The
musicians’ union required so-called stand-in musicians or even whole
orchestras to be employed in many cases where only phonograph records were
needed.</p>

<p>By 1961 there was no sign that the fallacy had died. Not only union
leaders but government officials talked solemnly of “automation” as a
major cause of unemployment. Automation was discussed as if it were
something entirely new in the world. It was in fact merely a new name for
continued technological advance and further progress in labor-saving
equipment.</p>
