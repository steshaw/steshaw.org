<p>But the opposition to labor-saving machinery, even today, is not confined
to economic illiterates. As late as 1970, a book appeared by a writer so
highly regarded that he has since received the Nobel Prize in economics. His
book opposed the introduction of laborsaving machines in the underdeveloped
countries on the ground that they <A href="#*">“decrease the demand for
labor”!*</a> The logical conclusion from this would be that the way to
maximize jobs is to make all labor as inefficient and unproductive as
possible. It implies that the English Luddite rioters, who in the early
nineteenth century destroyed stocking frames, steam-power looms, and
shearing machines, were after all doing the right thing.</p>

<p>One might pile up mountains of figures to show how wrong were the
technophobes of the past. But it would do no good unless we understood
clearly <i>why </i>they were wrong. For statistics and history are useless
in economics unless accompanied by a basic <i>deductive </i>understanding of
the facts—which means in this case an understanding of why the past
consequences of the introduction of machinery and other labor-saving devices
<i>had </i>to occur. Otherwise the technophobes will assert (as they do in
fact assert when you point out to them that the prophecies of their
predecessorsturned out to be absurd): “That may have been all very well in
the past but today conditions are fundamentally different; and now we simply
cannot afford to develop any more labor-saving machines.” Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt, indeed, in a syndicated newspaper column of September19, 1945,
wrote: “We have reached a point today where labor-saving devices are good
only when they do not throw the worker out of his job.”</p>

<p>If it were indeed true that the introduction of labor-saving machinery
is a cause of constantly mounting unemployment and misery, the logical
conclusions to be drawn would be revolutionary, not only in the technical
field but for our whole concept of civilization. Not only should we have to
regard all further technical progress as a calamity; we should have to
regard all past technical progress with equal horror. Every day each of us
in his own activity is engaged in trying to reduce the effort it requires to
accomplish a given result. Each of us is trying to save his own labor, to
economize the means required to achieve his ends. Every employer, small as
well as large, seeks constantly to gain his results more economically and
efficiently— that is, by saving labor. Every intelligent workman tries to
cut down the effort necessary to accomplish his assigned job. The most
ambitious of us try tirelessly to increase the results we can achieve in a
given number of hours. The technophobes, if they were logical and
consistent, would have to dismiss all this progress and ingenuity as not
only useless but vicious. Why should freight be carried from Chicago to New
York by railroad when we could employ enormously more men, for example, to
carry it all on their backs?</p>

<p>Theories as false as this are never held with
logical consistency, but they do great harm because they are held at all. Let us,
therefore, try to see exactly what happens when technical improvements and
labor-saving machinery are introduced. The details will vary in each instance,
depending upon the particular conditions that prevail in a given industry or
period. But we shall assume an example that involves the main possibilities.</p>

<p>Suppose a clothing manufacturer learns of a machine
that will make men’s and women s overcoats for half as much labor as
previously. He installs the machines and drops half his labor force.</p>

<p>This looks at first glance like a clear loss of
employment. But the machine itself required labor to make it; so here, as one
offset, are jobs that would not otherwise have existed. The manufacturer,
however, would have adopted the machine only if it had either made better suits
for half as much labor, or had made the same kind of suits at a smaller cost.
If we assume the latter, we cannot assume that the amount of labor to make the
machines was as great in terms of payrolls as the amount of labor that the
clothing manufacturer hopes to save in the long run by adopting the machine;
otherwise there would have been no economy, and he would not have adopted it.</p>

<p>So there is still a net loss of employment to be
accounted for. But we should at least keep in mind the real possibility that
even the <i>first </i>effect of the
introduction of labor-saving machinery may be to increase employment on net
balance; because it is usually only <i>in
the long run </i>that the clothing manufacturer expects to save money by
adopting the machine: it may take several years for the machine to “pay for
itself.”</p>

<p>After the machine has produced economies sufficient
to offset its cost, the clothing manufacturer has more profits than before. (We
shall assume that he merely sells his coats for the same price as his
competitors and makes no effort to undersell them.) At this point, it may seem,
labor has suffered a net loss of employment, while it is only the manufacturer,
the capitalist, who has gained. But it is precisely out of these extra profits
that the subsequent social gains must come. The manufacturer must use these
extra profits in at least one of three ways, and possibly he will use part of
them in all three: (1) he will use the extra profits to expand his operations
by buying more machines to make more coats; or (2) he will invest the extra
profits in some other industry; or <b>(3) </b>he will spend the extra
profits on increasing his own consumption. Whichever of these three courses he
takes, he will increase employment.</p>

<p>In other words, the manufacturer, as a result of his
economies, has profits that he did not have before. Every dollar of the amount
he has saved in direct wages to former coat makers, he now has to pay out in
indirect wages to the makers of the new machine, or to the workers in another
capital-using industry, or to the makers of a new house or car for himself or
for jewelry and furs for his wife. In any case (unless he is a pointless
hoarder) he gives indirectly as many jobs as he ceased to give directly.</p>

<p>But the matter does not and cannot rest at this
stage. If this enterprising manufacturer effects great economies as compared
with his competitors, either he will begin to expand his operations at their
expense, or they will start buying the machines too. Again more work will be
given to the makers of the machines. But competition and production will then
also begin to force down the price of overcoats. There will no longer be as
great profits for those who adopt the new machines. The rate of profit of the
manufacturers using the new machine will begin to drop, while the manufacturers
who have still not adopted the machine may now make no profit at all. The
savings, in other words, will begin to be passed along to the buyers of
overcoats—to the <i>consumers.</i></p>

<p>But as overcoats are now cheaper, more people will
buy them. This means that, though it takes fewer people to make the same number
of overcoats as before, more overcoats are now being made than before. If the
demand for overcoats is what economists call “elastic”—that is, if a fall in
the price of overcoats causes a larger total amount of money to be spent on
overcoats than previously— then more people may be employed even in making
overcoats than before the new labor-saving machine was introduced. We have already
seen how this actually happened historically with stockings and other textiles.</p>

<p>But the new employment does not depend on the
elasticity of demand for the particular product involved. Suppose that, though
the price of overcoats was almost cut in half—from a former price, say, of $150
to a new price of $100—not a single additional coat was sold. The result would
be that while consumers were as well provided with new overcoats as before,
each buyer would now have $50 left over that he would not have had left over before. He will therefore spend
this $50 for something else, and so provide increased employment in <i>other </i>lines.</p>

<p>In brief, on net balance machines, technological
improvements, automation, economies and efficiency do not throw men out of
work.</p>
