<p>I HAVE REFERRED to various union make-work and
featherbed practices. These practices, and the public toleration of them,
spring from the same fundamental fallacy as the fear of machines. This is the
belief that a more efficient way of doing a thing destroys jobs, and its
necessary corollary that a less efficient way of doing it creates them.</p>

<p>Allied to this fallacy is the belief that there is
just a fixed amount of work to be done in the world, and that, if we cannot add
to this work by thinking up more cumbersome ways of doing it, at least we can
think of devices for spreading it around among as large a number of people as
possible.</p>

<p>This error lies behind the minute subdivision of
labor upon which unions insist. In the building trades in large cities the subdivision
is notorious. Bricklayers are not allowed to use stones for a chimney: that is
the special work of stonemasons. An electrician cannot rip out a board to fix
a connection and put it back again: that is the special job, no matter how
simple it may be, of the carpenters. A plumber will not remove or put back a
tile incident to fixing a leak in the shower: that is the job of a tile-setter.</p>

<p>Furious “jurisdictional” strikes are fought among unions for the
exclusive right to do certain types of borderline jobs. In a statement
prepared by the American railroads for the Attorney-General’s Committee on
Administrative Procedure, the roads gave innumerable examples in which the
National Railroad Adjustment Board had decided that
	<blockquote><p>each separate operation on the railroad, no
	matter how minute, such as talking over a telephone or
	spiking or unspiking a switch, is so far an exclusive
	property of a particular class of employee that if an
	employee of another class, in the course of his regular
	duties, performs such operations he must not only be paid
	an extra day’s wages for doing so, but at the same time
	the furloughed or unemployed members of the class held to
	be entitled to perform the operation must be paid a
	day’s wages for not having been called upon to perform
	it.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that a few persons can profit at the expense of
the rest of us from this minute arbitrary subdivision of
labor— provided it happens in their case alone. But those
who support it as a general practice fail to see that it
always raises production costs; that it results on net
balance in less work done and in fewer goods produced. The
householder who is forced to employ two men to do the work of
one has, it is true, given employment to one extra man. But
he has just that much less money left over to spend on
something that would employ somebody else. Because his
bathroom leak has been repaired at double what it should have
cost, he decides not to buy the new sweater he wanted.
“Labor” is no better off, because a day’s employment of
an unneeded tile-setter has meant a day’s disemployment of a
sweater knitter or machine handler. The householder, however,
is worse off. Instead of having a repaired shower and a
sweater, he has the shower and no sweater. And if we count the
sweater as part of the national wealth, the country is short
one sweater. This symbolizes the net result of the effort to
make extra work by arbitrary subdivision of labor.</p>

<p>But there are other schemes for “spreading the work,” often put
forward by union spokesmen and legislators. The most frequent of these is
the proposal to shorten the working week, usually by law. The belief that it
would “spread the work” and “give more jobs” was one of the main
reasons behind the inclusion of the penaltyovertime provision in the
existing Federal Wage-Hour Law. The previous legislation in the states,
forbidding the employment of women or minors for more, say, than forty-eight
hours a week, was based on the conviction that longer hours were injurious
to health and morale. Some of it was based on the belief that longer hours
were harmful to efficiency. But the provision in the federal law, that an
employer must pay a worker a 50 percent premium above his regular hourly
rate of wages for all hours worked in any week above forty, was not based
primarily on the belief that forty-five hours a week, say, was injurious
either to health or efficiency. It was inserted partly in the hope of
boosting the worker’s weekly income, and partly in the hope that, by
discouraging the employer from taking on anyone regularly for more than
forty hours a week, it would force him to employ additional workers instead.
At the time of writing this, there are many schemes for “averting
unemployment” by enacting a thirty-hour week or a four-day week.</p>

<p>What is the actual effect of such plans, whether enforced by individual
unions or by legislation? It will clarify the problem if we consider two
cases. The first is a reduction in the standard working week from forty
hours to thirty without any change in the hourly rate of pay. The second is
a reduction in the working week from forty hours to thirty, but with a
sufficient increase in hourly wage rates to maintain the same weekly pay for
the individual workers already employed.</p>

<p>Let us take the first case. We assume that the working week is cut from
forty hours to thirty, with no change in hourly pay. If there is substantial
unemployment when this plan is put into effect, the plan will no doubt
provide additional jobs. We cannot assume that it will provide sufficient
additional jobs, however, to maintain the same payrolls and the same number
of man-hours as before, unless we make the unlikely assumptions that in each
industry there has been exactly the same percentage of unemployment and that
the new men and women employed are no less efficient at their special tasks
on the average than those who had already been employed. But suppose we do
make these assumptions. Suppose we do assume that the right number of
additional workers of each skill is available, and that the new workers do
not raise production costs. What will be the result of reducing the working
week from forty hours to thirty (without any increase in hourly pay)?</p>

<p>Though more workers will be employed, each will be working fewer hours,
and there will, therefore, be no net increase in man-hours. It is unlikely
that there will be any significant increase in production. Total payrolls
and “purchasing power” will be no larger. All that will have happened,
even under the most favorable assumptions (which would seldom be realized)
is that the workers previously employed will subsidize, in effect, the
workers previously unemployed. For in order that the new workers will
individually receive three-fourths as many dollars a week as the old workers
used to receive, the old workers will themselves now individually receive
only three-fourths as many dollars a week as previously. It is true that the
old workers will now work fewer hours; but this purchase of more leisure at
a high price is presumably not a decision they have made for its own sake:
it is a sacrifice made to provide <i>others </i>with jobs.</p>

<p>The labor union leaders who demand shorter weeks to “spread the work”
usually recognize this, and therefore they put the proposal forward in a
form in which everyone is supposed to eat his cake and have it too. Reduce
the working week from forty hours to thirty, they tell us, to provide more
jobs; but compensate for the shorter week by <i>increasing </i>the hourly
rate of pay by 33.33 percent. The workers employed, say, were previously
getting an average of $226 a week for forty hours work; in order that they
may still get $226 for only thirty hours work, the hourly rate of pay must
be advanced to an average of more than $7.53.</p>

<p>What would be the consequences of such a plan? The first and most obvious
consequence would be to raise costs of production. If we assume that the
workers, when previously employed for forty hours, were getting less than
the level of production costs, prices and profits made possible, then they
could have got the hourly increase <i>without </i>reducing the length of the
working week. They could, in other words, have worked the same number of
hours and got their total weekly incomes <i>increased by one-third,
</i>instead of merely getting, as they are under the new thirty-hour week,
the same weekly income as before. But if under the forty-hour week, the
workers were already getting as high a wage as the level of production costs
and prices made possible (and the very unemployment they are trying to cure
may be a sign that they were already getting even more than this), then the
increase in production costs as a result of the 33.33 percent increase in
hourly wage rates will be much greater than the existing state of prices,
production and costs can stand.</p>

<p>The result of the higher wage rate, therefore, will
be a much greater unemployment than before. The least efficient firms will be
thrown out of business, and the least efficient workers will be thrown out of
jobs. Production will be reduced all around the circle. Higher production costs
and scarcer supplies will tend to raise prices, so that workers can buy less
with the same dollar wages; on the other hand, the increased unemployment will
shrink demand and hence tend to lower prices. What ultimately happens to the
prices of goods will depend upon what monetary policies are then allowed. But
if a policy of monetary inflation is pursued, to enable prices to rise so that
the increased hourly wages can be paid, this will merely be a disguised way of
reducing <i>real </i>wage rates, so that
these will return, in terms of the amount of goods they can purchase, to the
same real rate as before. The result would then be the same as if the working
week had been reduced <i>without </i>an
increase in hourly wage rates. And the results of that have already been
discussed.</p>

<p>The spread-the-work schemes, in brief, rest on the same sort of illusion
that we have been considering. The people who support such schemes think
only of the employment they might provide for particular persons or groups;
they do not stop to consider what their whole effect would be on
everybody.</p>

<p>The spread-the-work schemes rest also, as we began by pointing out, on
the false assumption that there is just a fixed amount of work to be done.
There could be no greater fallacy. There is no limit to the amount of work
to be done as long as any human need or wish that work could fill remains
unsatisfied. In a modern exchange economy, the most work will be done when
prices, costs and wages are in the best relations with each other. What
these relations are we shall later consider.</p>
