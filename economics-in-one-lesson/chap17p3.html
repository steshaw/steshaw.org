<p>Price-fixing may often appear for a short period to be successful. lt can
seem to work well for a while, particularly in wartime, when it is supported
by patriotism and a sense of crisis. But the longer it is in effect the more
its difficulties increase. When prices are arbitrarily held down by
government compulsion, demand is <i>chronically </i>in excess of supply. We
have seen that if the government attempts to prevent a shortage of a
commodity by reducing also the prices of the labor, raw materials and other
factors that go into its cost of production, it creates a shortage of these
in turn. But not only will the government, if it pursues this course, find
it necessary to extend price control more and more downwards, or
“vertically”; it will find it no less necessary to extend price control
“horizontally.” If we ration one commodity, and the public cannot get
enough of it, though it still has excess purchasing power, it will turn to
some substitute. The rationing of each commodity as it grows scarce, in
other words, must put more and more pressure on the unrationed commodities
that remain. If we assume that the government is successful in its efforts
to prevent black markets (or at least prevents them from developing on a
sufficient scale to nullify its legal prices), continued price control must
drive it to the rationing of more and more commodities. This rationing
cannot stop with consumers. In World War II it did not stop with consumers.
It was applied first of all, in fact, in the allocation of raw materials to
producers.</p>

<p>The natural consequence of a thoroughgoing over-all price control which
seeks to perpetuate a given historic price level, in brief, must ultimately
be a completely regimented economy. Wages would have to be held down as
rigidly as prices. Labor would have to be rationed as ruthlessly as raw
materials. The end result would be that the government would not only tell
each consumer precisely how much of each commodity he could have; it would
tell each manufacturer precisely what quantity of each raw material he could
have and what quantity of labor. Competitive bidding for workers could no
more be tolerated than competitive bidding for materials. The result would
be a petrified totalitarian economy, with every business firm and every
worker at the mercy of the government, and with a final abandonment of all
the traditional liberties we have known. For as Alexander Hamilton pointed
out in the <i>Federalist Papers </i>nearly two centuries ago, “A power
over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.”</p>
