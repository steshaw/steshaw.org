<p>THE ECONOMIC GOAL of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the
greatest results with the least effort. The whole economic progress of
mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor. It is
for this reason that men began putting burdens on the backs of mules instead
of on their own; that they went on to invent the wheel and the wagon, the
railroad and the motor truck. It is for this reason that men used their
ingenuity to develop a hundred thousand labor-saving inventions.</p>

<p>All this is so elementary that one would blush to state it if it were not
being constantly forgotten by those who coin and circulate the new slogans.
Translated into national terms, this first principle means that our real
objective is to maximize production. In doing this, full employment—that
is, the absence of involuntary idleness—becomes a necessary byproduct. But
production is the end, employment merely the means. We cannot continuously
have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily
have full employment without full production.</p>

<p>Primitive tribes are naked, and wretchedly fed and housed, but they do
not suffer from unemployment. China and India are incomparably poorer than
ourselves, but the main trouble from which they suffer is primitive
production methods (which are both a cause and a consequence of a shortage
of capital) and not unemployment. Nothing is easier to achieve than full
employment, once it is divorced from the goal of full production and taken
as an end in itself. Hitler provided full employment with a huge armament
program. World War II provided full employment for every nation involved.
The slave labor in Germany had full employment. Prisons and chain gangs have
full employment. Coercion can always provide full employment.</p>

<p>Yet our legislators do not present Full Production bills in Congress but
Full Employment bills. Even committees of businessmen recommend “a
President’s Commission on Full Employment,” not on Full Production, or
even on Full Employment <i>and </i>Full Production. Everywhere the means is
erected into the end, and the end itself is forgotten.</p>

<p>Wages and employment are discussed as if they had no relation to
productivity and output. On the assumption that there is only a fixed amount
of work to be done, the conclusion is drawn that a thirty-hour week will
provide more jobs and will therefore be preferable to a forty-hour week. A
hundred make-work practices of labor unions are confusedly tolerated. When a
Petrillo threatens to put a radio station out of business unless it employs
twice as many musicians as it needs, he is supported by part of the public
because he is after all merely trying to create jobs. When we had our
<b>WPA, </b>it was considered a mark of genius for the administrators to
think of projects that employed the largest number of men in relation to the
value of the work performed—in other words, in which labor was least
efficient.</p>

<p>It would be far better, if that were the choice—which it isn’t—to
have maximum production with part of the population supported in idleness by
undisguised relief than to provide “full employment” by so many forms of
disguised make-work that production is disorganized. The progress of
civilization has meant the reduction of employment, not its increase. It is
because we have become increasingly wealthy as a nation that we have been
able virtually to eliminate child labor, to remove the necessity of work for
many of the aged and to make it unnecessary for millions of women to take
jobs. A much smaller proportion of the American population needs to work
than that, say, of China or of Russia. The real question is not how many
millions of jobs there will be in America ten years from now, but how much
shall we produce, and what, in consequence, will be our standard of living?
The problem of distribution on which all the stress is being put today, is
after all more easily solved the more there is to distribute.</p>

<p>We can clarify our thinking if we put our chief emphasis where it
belongs—on policies that will maximize production.</p>
