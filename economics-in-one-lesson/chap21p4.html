<p>This brings us to the general meaning and effect of
economic <i>equilibrium. </i>Equilibrium wages and prices are
the wages and prices that equalize supply and demand. If,
either through government or private coercion, an attempt is
made to lift prices above their equilibrium level, demand is
reduced and therefore production is reduced. If an attempt is
made to push prices below their equilibrium level, the
consequent reduction or wiping out of profits will mean a
falling off of supply or less production. Therefore any
attempt to force prices either above or below their
equilibrium levels (which are the levels toward which a free
market constantly tends to bring them) will act to reduce the
volume of employment and production below what it would
otherwise have been.</p>

<p>To return, then, to the doctrine that labor must get
“enough to buy back the product.” The national product, it
should be obvious, is neither created nor bought by
manufacturing labor alone. It is bought by everyone—by white
collar workers, professional men, farmers, employers, big and
little, by investors, grocers, butchers, owners of small
drugstores and gasoline stations—by everybody, in short, who
contributes toward making the product.</p>

<p>As to the prices, wages and profits that should determine
the distribution of that product, the best prices are not the
highest prices, but the prices that encourage the largest
volume of production and the largest volume of sales. The best
wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the
wage rates that permit full production, full employment and
the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the
standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the
lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to
become employers or to provide more employment than
before.</p>

<p>If we try to run the economy for the benefit of a single
group or class, we shall injure or destroy all groups,
including the members of the very class for whose benefit we
have been trying to run it. We must run the economy for
everybody.</p>
