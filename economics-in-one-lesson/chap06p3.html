<p>We remarked at the beginning of this chapter that
government “aid” to business is sometimes as much to be feared as government
hostility. This applies as much to government subsidies as to government loans.
The government never lends or gives anything to business that it does not take
away from business. One often hears New Dealers and other statists boast about
the way government “bailed business out” with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
the Home Owners Loan Corporation and other government agencies in 1932 and
later. But the government can give no financial help to business that it does
not first or finally take from business. The government’s funds all come from
taxes. Even the much vaunted “government credit” rests on the assumption that
its loans will ultimately be repaid out of the proceeds of taxes. When the
government makes loans or subsidies to business, what it does is to tax successful
private business in order to support unsuccessful private business. Under
certain emergency circumstances there may be a plausible argument for this,
the merits of which we need not examine here. But in the long run it does not
sound like a paying proposition from the standpoint of the country as a whole.
And experience has shown that it isn’t.</p>
