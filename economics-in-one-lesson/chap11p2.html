<p>An American manufacturer of woolen sweaters goes to Congress or to the
State Department and tells the committee or officials concerned that it
would be a national disaster for them to remove or reduce the tariff on
British sweaters. He now sells his sweaters for $30 each, but English
manufacturers could sell their sweaters of the same quality for $25. A duty
of $5, therefore, is needed to keep him in business. He is not thinking of
himself, of course, but of the thousand men and women he employs, and of the
people to whom their spending in turn gives employment. Throw them out of
work, and you create unemployment and a fall in purchasing power, which
would spread in ever-widening circles. And if he can prove that he really
would be forced out of business if the tariff were removed or reduced, his
argument against that action is regarded by Congress as conclusive.</p>

<p>But the fallacy comes from looking merely at this manufacturer and his
employees, or merely at the American sweater industry. It comes from
noticing only the results that are immediately seen, and neglecting the
results that are not seen because they are prevented from coming into
existence.</p>

<p>The lobbyists for tariff protection are continually putting forward
arguments that are not factually correct. But let us assume that the facts
in this case are precisely as the sweater manufacturer has stated them. Let
us assume that a tariff of $5 a sweater is necessary for him to stay in
business and provide employment at sweater-making for his workers.</p>

<p>We have deliberately chosen the most unfavorable example of any for the
removal of a tariff. We have not taken an argument for the imposition of a
new tariff in order to bring a new industry into existence, but an argument
for the retention of a tariff <i>that has already brought an industry into
existence,</i> and cannot be repealed without hurting somebody.</p>


<p>The tariff is repealed; the manufacturer goes out of business; a thousand
workers are laid off; the particular tradesmen whom they patronized are
hurt. This is the immediate result that is seen. But there are also results
which, while much more difficult to trace, are no less immediate and no less
real. For now sweaters that formerly cost retail $30 apiece can be bought
for $25. Consumers can now buy the same quality of sweater for less money,
or a much better one for the same money. If they buy the same quality of
sweater, they not only get the sweater, but they have $5 left over, which
they would not have had under the previous conditions, to buy something
else. With the $25 that they pay for the imported sweater they help
employment—as the American manufacturer no doubt predicted — in the
sweater industry in England. With the $5 left over they help employment in
any number of other industries in the United States.</p>

<p>But the results do not end there. By buying English sweaters they furnish
the English with dollars to buy American goods here. This, in fact (if I may
here disregard such complications as fluctuating exchange rates, loans,
credits, etc.) is the only way in which the British can eventually make use
of these dollars. Because we have permitted the British to sell more to us,
they are now able to buy more from tis. They are, in fact, eventually
<i>forced </i>to buy more from us if their dollar balances are not to remain
perpetually unused. So as a result of letting in more British goods, we must
export more American goods. And though fewer people are now employed in the
American sweater industry, more people are employed—and much more
efficiently employed—in, say, the American washing-machine or
aircraft-building business. American employment on net balance has not gone
down, but American and British production on net balance has gone up. Labor
in each country is more fully employed in doing just those things that it
does best, instead of being forced to do things that it does inefficiently
or badly. Consumers in both countries are better off. They are able to buy
what they want where they can get it cheapest. American consumers are better
provided with sweaters, and British consumers are better provided with
washing machines and aircraft.</p>
