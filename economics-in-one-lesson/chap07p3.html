<p>Not all inventions and discoveries, of course, are
“labor-saving” machines. Some of them, like precision instruments, like nylon,
lucite, plywood and plastics of all kinds, simply improve the quality of
products. Others, like the telephone or the airplane, perform operations that
direct human labor could not perform at all. Still others bring into existence
objects and services, such as X-ray machines, radios, TV sets, air-conditioners
and computers, that would otherwise not even exist. But in the foregoing
illustration we have taken precisely the kind of machine that has been the
special object of modern technophobia.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, to push too far the
argument that machines do not on net balance throw men out of work. It is
sometimes argued, for example, that machines create more jobs than would
otherwise have existed. Under certain conditions this may be true. They can
certainly create enormously more jobs <i>in
particular trades. </i>The eighteenth century figures for the textile
industries are a case in point. Their modern counterparts are certainly no less
striking. In 1910, 140,000 persons were employed in the United States in the
newly created automobile industry. In 1920, as the product was improved and its
cost reduced, the industry employed 250,000 In 1930, as this product
improvement and cost reduction continued, employment in the industry was
380,000. In 1973 it had risen to 941,000. By 1973, 514,000 people were employed
in making aircraft and aircraft parts, and 393,000 were engaged in making
electronic components. So it has been in one
newly created trade after another, as the invention was improved and the cost
reduced.<A
href="chap28p1.html#02PM"><sup>2</sup></A></p>

<p>There is also an absolute sense in which machines
may be said to have enormously increased the number of jobs. The population of
the world today is four times as great as in the middle of the eighteenth
century, before the Industrial Revolution had got well under way. Machines may
be said to have given birth to this increased population; for without the
machines, the world would not have been able to support it. Three out of every
four of us, therefore, may be said to owe not only our jobs but our very lives
to machines.</p>

<p>Yet it is a misconception to think of the function
or result of machines as primarily one of creating <i>jobs. </i>The real result of the machine is to increase <i>production, </i>to raise the standard of
living, to increase economic welfare. It is no trick to employ everybody, even
(or especially) in the most primitive economy. Full employment—very full
employment; long, weary, backbreaking employment—is characteristic of
precisely the nations that are most retarded industrially. Where full
employment already exists, new machines, inventions and discoveries
cannot—until there has been time for an increase in population — bring <i>more </i>employment. They are likely to bring more unemployment (but
this time I am speaking of <i>voluntaiy </i>and
not involuntary unemployment) because people can now afford to work fewer
hours, while children and the overaged no longer need to work.</p>

<p>What machines do, to repeat, is to bring an increase
in production and an increase in the standard of living. They may do this in
either of two ways. They do it by making goods cheaper for consumers (as in our
illustration of the overcoats), or they do it by increasing wages because they
increase the productivity of the workers. In other words, they either increase
money wages or, by reducing prices, they increase the goods and services that
the same money wages will buy. Sometimes they do both. What actually happens
will depend in large part upon the monetary policy pursued in a country. But in
any case, machines, inventions and discoveries increase
<i>real</i> wages.</p>
