<p>The enemies of saving are not through. They begin by
drawing a distinction, which is proper enough, between
“savings” and “investment.” But then they start to
talk as if the two were independent variables and as if it
were merely an accident that they should ever equal each
other. These writers paint a portentous picture. On the one
side are savers automatically, pointlessly, stupidly
continuing to save; on the other side are limited
“investment opportunities” that cannot absorb this saving.
The result, alas, is stagnation. The only solution, they
declare, is for the government to expropriate these stupid and
harmful savings and to invent its own projects, even if these
are only useless ditches or pyramids, to use up the money and
provide employment.</p>

<p>There is so much that is false in this picture and
“solution” that we can here point only to some of the main
fallacies. Savings can exceed investment only by the amounts
that are actually <A href="#*"><i>hoarded in
cash.’<sup>[*]</sup></i></a> Few people nowadays, in a
modern industrial community, hoard coins and bills in
stockings or under mattresses. To the small extent that this
may occur, it has already been reflected in the production
plans of business and in the price level. It is not ordinarily
even cumulative: dishoarding, as eccentric recluses die and
their hoards are discovered and dissipated, probably offsets
new hoarding. In fact, the whole amount involved is probably
insignificant in its effect on business activity.</p>

<p>If money is kept either in savings banks or commercial
banks, as we have already seen, the banks are eager to lend
and invest it. They cannot afford to have idle funds. The only
thing that will cause people generally to try to increase
their holdings of cash, or that will cause banks to hold funds
idle and lose the interest on them, is, as we have seen,
either fear that prices of goods are going to fall or the fear
of banks that they will be taking too great a risk with their
principal. But this means that signs of a depression have
already appeared, and have caused the hoarding, rather than
that the hoarding has started the depression.</p>

<p>Apart from this negligible hoarding of cash, then (and even
this exception might be thought of as a direct
“investment” in money itself) savings and investment are
brought into equilibrium with each other in the same way that
the supply of and demand for any commodity are brought into
equilibrium. For we may define savings and investment as
constituting respectively the supply of and demand for new
capital. And just as the supply of and demand for any other
commodity are equalized by price, so the supply of and demand
for capital are equalized by interest rates. The interest rate
is merely the special name for the price of loaned capital. It
is a price like any other.</p>

<p>This whole subject has been so appallingly confused in
recent years by complicated sophistries and disastrous
governmental policies based upon them that one almost despairs
of getting back to common sense and sanity about it. There is
a psychopathic fear of “excessive” interest rates. It is
argued that if interest rates are too high it will not be
profitable for industry to borrow and invest in new plants and
machines. This argument has been so effective that governments
everywhere in recent decades have pursued artificial
“cheap-money” policies. But the argument, in its concern
with increasing the demand for capital, overlooks the effect
of these policies on the supply of capital. It is one more
example of the fallacy of looking at the effects of a policy
only on one group and forgetting the effects on another.</p>

<p>If interest rates are artificially kept too low in relation
to risks, there will be a reduction in both saving and
lending. The cheap-money proponents believe that saving goes
on automatically, regardless of the interest rate, because the
sated rich have nothing else that they can do with their
money. They do not stop to tell us at precisely what personal
income level a man saves a fixed minimum amount regardless of
the rate of interest or the risk at which he can lend it.</p>

<p>The fact is that, though the volume of saving of the very
rich is doubtless affected much less proportionately than that
of the moderately well-off by changes in the interest rate,
practically everyone’s saving is affected in some degree. To
argue, on the basis of an extreme example, that the volume of
real savings would not be reduced by a substantial reduction
in the interest rate, is like arguing that the total
production of sugar would not be reduced by a substantial fall
of its price because the efficient, low-cost producers would
still raise as much as before. The argument overlooks the
marginal saver, and even, indeed, the great majority of
savers.</p>

<p>The effect of keeping interest rates artificially low, in
fact, is eventually the same as that of keeping any other
price below the natural market. It increases demand and
reduces supply. It increases the demand for capital and
reduces the supply of real capital. It creates economic
distortions. It is true, no doubt, that an artificial
reduction in the interest rate encourages increased borrowing.
It tends, in fact, to encourage highly speculative ventures
that cannot continue except under the artificial conditions
that gave them birth. On the supply side, the artificial
reduction of interest rates discourages normal thrift, saving,
and investment. It reduces the accumulation of capital. It
slows down that increase in productivity, that “economic
growth,” that “progressives” profess to be so eager to
promote.</p>

<p>The money rate can, indeed, be kept artificially low only
by continuous new injections of currency or bank credit in
place of real savings. This can create the illusion of more
capital just as the addition of water can create the illusion
of more milk. But it is a policy of continuous inflation. It
is obviously a process involving cumulative danger. The money
rate will rise and a crisis will develop if the inflation is
reversed, or merely brought to a halt, or even continued at a
diminished rate.</p>

<p>It remains to be pointed out that while new injections of
currency or bank credit can at first, and temporarily, bring
about lower interest rates, persistence in this device must
eventually <i>raise </i>interest rates. It does so because new
injections of money tend to lower the purchasing power of
money. Lenders then come to realize that the money they lend
today will buy less a year from now, say, when they get it
back. Therefore to the normal interest rate they add a premium
to compensate them for this expected loss in their money s
purchasing power. This premium can be high, depending on the
extent of the expected inflation. Thus the annual interest
rate on British treasury bills rose to 14 percent in 1976;
Italian government bonds yielded 16 percent in ‘977; and the
discount rate of the central bank of Chile soared to 75
percent in 1974. Cheap-money policies, in short, eventually
bring about far more violent oscillations in business than
those they are designed to remedy or prevent.</p>

<p>If no effort is made to tamper with money rates through
inflationary governmental policies, increased savings create
their own demand by lowering interest rates in a natural
manner. The greater supply of savings seeking investment
forces savers to accept lower rates. But lower rates also mean
that more enterprises can afford to borrow because their
prospective profit on the new machines or plants they buy with
the proceeds seems likely to exceed what they have to pay for
the borrowed funds.</p>

<div class =footnote><A NAME="*">* Many of</A> the differences
between economists in the diverse views now expressed on this
subject are merely the result of differences in definition.
<i>Savings </i>and <i>investment </i>may be so defined as to
be identical, and therefore necessarily equal. Here I am
choosing to define <i>savings </i>in terms of money and
investment in terms of goods. This corresponds roughly with
the common use of the words, which is, however, not
consistent.</div>
