<p>Let us now turn to such a society. How is the problem of alternative
applications of labor and capital, to meet thousands of different needs and
wants of different urgencies, solved in such a society? It is solved
precisely through the price system. It is solved through the constantly
changing interrelationships of costs of production, prices and profits.</p>

<p>Prices are fixed through the relationship of supply and demand and in
turn affect supply and demand. When people want more of an article, they
offer more for it. The price goes up. This increases the profits of those
who make the article. Because it is now more profitable to make that article
than others, the people already in the business expand their production of
it, and more people are attracted to the business. This increased supply
then reduces the price and reduces the profit margin, until the profit
margin on that article once more falls to the general level of profits
(relative risks considered) in other industries. Or the demand for that
article may fall; or the supply of it may be increased to such a point that
its price drops to a level where there is less profit in making it than in
making other articles; or perhaps there is an actual loss in making it. In
this case the “marginal” producers, that is, the producers who are least
efficient, or whose costs of production are highest, will be driven out of
business altogether. The product will now be made only by the more efficient
producers who operate on lower costs. The supply of that commodity will also
drop, or will at least cease to expand.</p>

<p>This process is the origin of the belief that prices are determined by
costs of production. The doctrine, stated in this form, is not true. Prices
are determined by supply and demand, and demand is determined by how
intensely people want a commodity and what they have to offer in exchange
for it. It is true that supply is in part determined by costs of production.
What a commodity <i>has </i>cost to produce in the past cannot determine its
value. That will depend on the <i>present </i>relationship of supply and
demand. But the expectations of businessmen concerning what a commodity
<i>will </i>cost to produce in the future, and what its future price will
be, will determine how much of it will be made. This will affect future
supply. There is therefore a constant tendency for the price of a commodity
and its marginal cost of production to <i>equal </i>each other, but not
because that marginal cost of production directly determines the price.</p>

<p>The private enterprise system, then, might be compared to thousands of
machines, each regulated by its own quasi-automatic governor, yet with these
machines and their governors all interconnected and influencing each other,
so that they act in effect like one great machine. Most of us must have
noticed the automatic governor” on a steam engine. It usually consists of
two balls or weights which work by centrifugal force. As the speed of the
engine increases, these balls fly away from the rod to which they are
attached and so automatically narrow or close off a throttle valvewhich
regulates the intake of steam and thus slows down the engine. If the engine
goes too slowly, on the other hand, the balls drop, widen the throttle
valve, and increase the engine’s speed. Thus every departure from the
desired speed itself sets in motion the forces that tend to correct that
departure.</p>

<p>It is precisely in this way that the relative supply of thousands of
different commodities is regulated under the system of competitive private
enterprise. When people want more of a commodity, their competitive bidding
raises its price. This increases the profits of the producers who make that
product. This stimulates them to increase their production. It leads others
to stop making some of the products they previously made, and turn to making
the product that offers them the better return. But this increases the
supply of that commodity at the same time that it reduces the supply of some
other commodities. The price of that product therefore falls in relation to
the price of other products, and the stimulus to the relative increase in
its production disappears.</p>

<p>In the same way, if the demand falls off for some product, its price and
the profit in making it go lower, and its production declines.</p>

<p>It is this last development that scandalizes those who do not understand
the “price system” they denounce. They accuse it of creating scarcity.
Why, they ask indignantly, should manufacturers cut off the production of
shoes at the point where it becomes unprofitable to produce any more? Why
should they be guided merely by their own profits? Why should they be guided
by the market? Why do they not produce shoes to the “full capacity of
modern technical processes”? The price system and private enterprise,
conclude the “production-for-use” philosophers, are merely a form of
“scarcity economics.”</p>

<p>These questions and conclusions stem from the fallacy of looking at one
industry in isolation, of looking at the tree and ignoring the forest. Up to
a certain point it is necessary to produce shoes. But it is also necessary
to produce coats, shirts, trousers, homes, plows, shovels, factories,
bridges, milk and bread. It would be idiotic to go on piling up mountains of
surplus shoes, simply because we could do it, while hundreds of more urgent
needs went unfilled.</p>

<p>Now, in an economy in equilibrium, a given industry can expand <i>only at
the expense of other industries. </i>For at any moment the factors of
production are limited. One industry can be expanded only by <i>diverting
</i>to it labor, land and capital that would otherwise be employed in other
industries. And when a given industry shrinks, or stops expanding its
output, it does not necessarily mean that there has been any <i>net
</i>decline in aggregate production. The shrinkage at that point may have
merely <i>released </i>labor and capital to <i>permit the expansion of other
industries. </i>It is erroneous to conclude, therefore, that a shrinkage of
production in one line necessarily means a shrinkage in <i>total
</i>production.</p>

<p>Everything, in short, is produced at the expense of forgoing something
else. Costs of production themselves, in fact, might be defined as the
things that are given up (the leisure and pleasures, the raw materials with
alternative potential uses) in order to create the thing that is made.</p>

<p>It follows that it is just as essential for the health of a dynamic
economy that dying industries should be allowed to die as that growing
industries should be allowed to grow. For the dying industries absorb labor
and capital that should be released for the growing industries. It is only
the much vilified price system that solves the enormously complicated
problem of deciding precisely how much of tens of thousands of different
commodities and services should be produced in relation to each other. These
otherwise bewildering equations are solved quasi-automatically by the system
of prices, profits and costs. They are solved by this system incomparably
better than any group of bureaucrats could solve them. For they are solved
by a system under which each consumer makes his own demand and casts a fresh
vote, or a dozen fresh votes, every day; whereas bureaucrats would try to
solve it by having made for the consumers, not what the consumers themselves
wanted, but what the bureaucrats decided was good for them. Yet though the
bureaucrats do not understand the quasi-automatic system of the market, they
are always disturbed by it. They are always trying to improve it or correct
it, usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group. What some of
the results of their intervention are, we shall examine in succeeding
chapters.</p>
