<p>We come now to the last fallacy about saving with which I
intend to deal. This is the frequent assumption that there is
a fixed limit to the amount of new capital that can be
absorbed, or even that the limit of capital expansion has
already been reached. It is incredible that such a view could
prevail even among the ignorant, let alone that it could be
held by any trained economist. Almost the whole wealth of the
modern world, nearly everything that distinguishes it from the
preindustrial world of the seventeenth century, consists of
its accumulated capital.</p>

<p>This capital is made up in part of many things that might
better be called consumers’ durable goods—automobiles,
refrigerators, furniture, schools, colleges, churches,
libraries, hospitals and above all private homes. Never in the
history of the world has there been enough of these. Even if
there were enough homes from a purely numerical point of view,
<i>qualitative </i>improvements are possible and desirable
without definite limit in all but the very best houses.</p>

<p>The second part of capital is what we may call capital
proper. It consists of the tools of production, including
everything from the crudest axe, knife or plow to the finest
machine tool, the greatest electric generator or cyclotron, or
the most wonderfully equipped factory. Here, too,
quantitatively and especially qualitatively, there is no limit
to the expansion that is possible and desirable. There will
not be a “surplus” of capital until the most backward
country is as well equipped technologically as the most
advanced, until the most inefficient factory in America is
brought abreast of the factory with the latest and finest
equipment, and until the most modern tools of production have
reached a point where human ingenuity is at a dead end, and
can improve them no further. As long as any of these
conditions remains unfulfilled, there will be indefinite room
for more capital.</p>

<p>But how can the additional capital be “absorbed”? How
can it be “paid for”? If it is set aside and saved, it
will absorb itself and pay for itself. For producers invest in
new capital goods—that is, they buy new and better and more
ingenious tools — because these tools <i>reduce costs of
production. </i>They either bring into existence goods that
completely unaided hand labor could not bring into existence
at all (and this now includes most of the goods around
us—books, typewriters, automobiles, locomotives, suspension
bridges); or they increase enormously the quantities in which
these can be produced; or (and this is merely saying these
things in a different way) they reduce <i>unit </i>costs of
production. And as there is no assignable limit to the extent
to which unit costs of production can be reduced—until
everything can be produced at no cost at all—there is no
assignable limit to the amount of new capital that can be
absorbed.</p>

<p>The steady reduction of unit costs of production by the
addition of new capital does either one of two things, or
both. It reduces the costs of goods to consumers, and it
increases the wages of the labor that uses the new equipment
because it increases the productive power of that labor. Thus
a new machine benefits both the people who work on it directly
and the great body of consumers. In the case of consumers we
may say either that it supplies them with more and better
goods for the same money, or, what is the same thing, that it
increases their real incomes. In the case of the workers who
use the new machines it increases their real wages in a double
way by increasing their money wages as well. A typical
illustration is the automobile business. The American
automobile industry pays the highest wages in the world, and
among the very highest even in America. Yet (until about 1960)
American motorcar makers could undersell the rest of the
world, because their unit cost was lower. And the secret was
that the capital used in making American automobiles was
greater per worker and per car than anywhere else in the
world.</p>

<p>And yet there are people who think we have reached the <A
href="#*"> end of this process,<sup>[*]</sup></a> and still
others who think that even if we haven’t, the world is
foolish to go on saving and adding to its stock of
capital.</p>

<p>It should not be difficult to decide, after our analysis,
with whom the real folly lies.</p>

<p>(It is true that the U. S. has been losing its world
economic leadership in recent years, but because of our own
anticapitalist governmental policies, not because of
“economic maturity.”)</p>
