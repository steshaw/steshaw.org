<p><span class="intro">The belief that</span> labor unions can
substantially raise real wages over the long run and for the
whole working population is one of the great delusions of the
present age. This delusion is mainly the result of failure to
recognize that wages are basically determined by labor
productivity. It is for this reason, for example, that wages
in the United States were incomparably higher than wages in
England and Germany all during the decades when the “labor
movement” in the latter two countries was far more
advanced.</p>

<p>In spite of the overwhelming evidence that labor
productivity is the fundamental determinant of wages, the
conclusion is usually forgotten or derided by labor union
leaders and by that large group of economic writers who seek a
reputation as “liberals” by parroting them. But this
conclusion does not rest on the assumption, as they suppose,
that employers are uniformly kind and generous men eager to do
what is right. It rests on the very different assumption that
the individual employer is eager to increase his own profits
to the maximum. If people are willing to work for less than
they are really worth to him, why should he not take the
fullest advantage of this? Why should he not prefer, for
example, to make $1 a week out of a workman rather than see
some other employer make $2 a week out of him? And as long as
this situation exists, there will be a tendency for employers
to bid workers up to their full economic worth.</p>

<p>All this does not mean that unions can serve no useful or
legitimate function. The central function they can serve is to
improve local working conditions and to assure that all of
their members get the true market value of their services.</p>

<p>For the competition of workers for jobs, and of employers
for workers, does not work perfectly. Neither individual
workers nor individual employers are likely to be fully
informed concerning the conditions of the labor market. An
individual worker may not know the true market value of his
services to an employer. And he may be in a weak bargaining
position. Mistakes of judgment are far more costly to him than
to an employer. If an employer mistakenly refuses to hire a
man from whose services he might have profited, he merely
loses the net profit he might have made from employing that
one man; and he may employ a hundred or a thousand men. But if
a worker mistakenly refuses a job in the belief that he can
easily get another that will pay him more, the error may cost
him dear. His whole means of livelihood is involved. Not only
may he fail to find promptly another job offering more; he may
fail for a time to find another job offering remotely as much.
And time may be the essence of his problem, because he and his
family must eat. So he may be tempted to take a wage that he
believes to be below his “real worth” rather than face
these risks. When an employer’s workers deal with him as a
body, however, and set a known “standard wage” for a given
class of work, they may help to equalize bargaining power and
the risks involved in mistakes.</p>

<p>But it is easy, as experience has proved, for unions,
particularly with the help of one-sided labor legislation
which puts compulsions solely on employers, to go beyond their
legitimate functions, to act irresponsibly, and to embrace
short-sighted and antisocial policies. TI do this, for
example, whenever they seek to fix the wages of their members
above their real market worth. Such an attempt always brings
about unemployment. The arrangement can be made to stick, in
fact, only by some form of intimidation or coercion.</p>

<p>One device consists in restricting the membership of the
union on some other basis than that of proved competence or
skill. restriction may take many forms: it may consist in
charging new workers excessive initiation fees; in arbitrary
membership qualifications; in discrimination, open or
concealed, on grounds of religion, race or sex; in some
absolute limitation on the number of members, or in exclusion,
by force if necessary, not only of the products of nonunion
labor, but of the products even of affiliated unions in other
states or cities.</p>

<p>The most obvious case in which intimidation and force are
used to put or keep the wages of a particular union above the
real market worth of its members’ services is that of a
strike. A peaceful strike is possible. To the extent that it
remains peaceful, it is a legitimate labor weapon, even though
it is one that should be used rarely and as a last resort. If
his workers as a body withhold their labor, they may bring a
stubborn employer, who has been underpaying them, to his
senses. He may find that he is unable to replace these workers
with workers equally good who are willing to accept the wage
that the former have now rejected. But the moment workers have
to use intimidation or violence to enforce their demands—the
moment they use mass picketing to prevent any of the old
workers from continuing at their jobs, or to prevent the
employer from hiring new permanent workers to take their
places—their case becomes suspect. For the pickets are
really being used, not primarily against the employer, but
against other workers. These other workers are willing to take
the jobs that the old employees have vacated, and at the wages
that the old employees now reject. The fact proves that the
other alternatives open to the new workers are not as good as
those that the old employees have refused. If, therefore, the
old employees succeed by force in preventing new workers from
taking the place, they prevent these new workers from choosing
the best alternative open to them, and force them to take
something worse. The strikers are therefore insisting on a
position of privilege, and are using force to maintain this
privileged position against other workers.</p>

<p>If the foregoing analysis is correct, the indiscriminate
hatred of the “strikebreaker” is not justified. If the
strikebreakers consist merely of professional thugs who
themselves threaten violence, or who cannot in fact do the
work, or if they are being paid a temporarily higher rate
solely for the purpose of making a pretense of carrying on
until the old workers are frightened back to work at the old
rates, the hatred may be warranted. But if they are in fact
merely men and women who are looking for permanent jobs and
willing to accept them at the old rate, then they are workers
who would be shoved into worse jobs than these in order to
enable the striking workers to enjoy better ones. And this
superior position for the old employees could continue to be
maintained, in fact, only by the ever-present threat of
force.</p>
