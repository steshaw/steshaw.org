<p>All this is not to argue that there is no way of raising
wages. It is merely to point out that the apparently easy
method of raising them by government fiat is the wrong way and
the worst way.</p>

<p>This is perhaps as good a place as any to point out that
what distinguishes many reformers from those who cannot accept
their proposals is not their greater philanthropy, but their
greater impatience. The question is not whether we wish to see
everybody as well off as possible. Among men of good will such
an aim can be taken for granted. The real question concerns
the proper means of achieving it. And in trying to answer this
we must never lose sight of a few elementary truisms. We
cannot distribute more wealth than is created. We cannot in
the long run pay labor as a whole more than it produces.</p>

<p>The best way to raise wages, therefore, is to raise
marginal labor productivity. This can be done by many methods:
by an increase in capital accumulation — i.e., by an
increase in the machines with which the workers are aided; by
new inventions and improvements; by more efficient management
on the part of employers; by more industriousness and
efficiency on the part of workers; by better education and
training. The more the individual worker produces, the more he
increases the wealth of the whole community. The more he
produces, the more his services are worth to consumers, and
hence to employers. And the more he is worth to employers, the
more he will be paid. Real wages come out of production, not
out of government decrees.</p>

<p>So government policy should be directed, not to imposing
more burdensome requirements on employers, but to following
policies that encourage profits, that encourage employers to
expand, to invest in newer and better machines to increase the
productivity of workers — in brief, to encourage capital
accumulation, instead of discouraging it—and to increase
both employment and wage rates.</p>
