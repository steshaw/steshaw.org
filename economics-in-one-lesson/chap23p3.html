<p>So inflation turns out to be merely one more example of our
central lesson. It may indeed bring benefits for a short time
to favored groups, but only at the expense of others. And in
the long run it brings ruinous consequences to the whole
community. Even a relatively mild inflation distorts the
structure of production. It leads to the overexpansion of some
industries at the expense of others. This involves a
misapplication and waste of capital. When the inflation
collapses, or is brought to a halt, the misdirected capital
investment—whether in the form of machines, factories or
office buildings—cannot yield an adequate return and loses
the greater part of its value.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible to bring inflation to a smooth and
gentle stop, and so avert a subsequent depression. It is not
even possible to halt an inflation once embarked upon, at some
preconceived point, or when prices have achieved a previously
agreed upon level; for both political and economic forces will
have got out of hand. You cannot make an argument for a 25
percent advance in prices by inflation without someone’s
contending that the argument is twice as good for an advance
of 50 percent, and someone else’s adding that it is four
times as good for an advance of 100 percent. The political
pressure groups that have benefited from the inflation will
insist upon its continuance.</p>

<p>It is impossible, moreover, to control the value of money
under inflation. For, as we have seen, the causation is never
a merely mechanical one. You cannot, for example, say in
advance that a 100 percent increase in the quantity of money
will mean a 50 percent fall in the value of the monetary unit.
The value of money, as we have seen, depends upon the
subjective valuations of the people who hold it. And those
valuations do not depend solely on the quantity of it that
each person holds. They depend also on the <i>quality </i>of
the money. In wartime the value of a nation’s monetary unit,
not on the gold standard, will rise on the foreign exchanges
with victory and fall with defeat, regardless of changes in
its quantity. The present valuation will often depend upon
what people expect the <i>future </i>quantity of money to be.
And, as with commodities on the speculative exchanges, each
person’s valuation of money is affected not only by what he
thinks its value is but by what he thinks is going to be
<i>eveiybody else’s </i>valuation of money.</p>

<p>All this explains why, when hyperinflation has once set in,
the value of the monetary unit drops at a far faster rate than
the quantity of money either is or can be increased. When this
stage is reached, the disaster is nearly complete; and the
scheme is bankrupt.</p>
