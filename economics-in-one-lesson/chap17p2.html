<p>In discussing this subject, there is no point in assuming a price control
that would fix prices exactly where a free market would place them in any
case. That would be the same as having no price control at all. We must
assume that the purchasing power in the hands of the public is greater than
the supply of goods available, and that prices are being held down by the
government <i>below </i>the levels to which a free market would put
them.</p>

<p>Now we cannot hold the price of any commodity below its market level
without in time bringing about two consequences. The first is to increase
the demand for that commodity. Because the commodity is cheaper, people are
both tempted to buy, and can afford to buy, more of it. The second
consequence is to reduce the supply of that commodity. Because people buy
more, the accumulated supply is more quickly taken from the shelves of
merchants. But in addition to this, production of that commodity is
discouraged. Profit margins are reduced or wiped out. The marginal producers
are driven out of business. Even the most efficient producers may be called
upon to turn out their product at a loss. This happened in World War II when
slaughter houses were required by the Office of Price Administration to
slaughter and process meat for less than the cost to them of cattle on the
hoof and the labor of slaughter and processing.</p>

<p>If we did nothing else, therefore, the consequence of fixing a maximum
price for a particular commodity would be to bring about a shortage of that
commodity. But this is precisely the opposite of what the government
regulators originally wanted to do. For it is the very commodities selected
for maximum price-fixing that the regulators most want to keep in abundant
supply. But when they limit the wages and the profits of those who make
these commodities, without also limiting the wages and profits of those who
make luxuries or semiluxuries, they discourage the production of the
price-controlled necessities while they relatively stimulate the production
of less essential goods.</p>

<p>Some of these consequences in time become apparent to the regulators, who
then adopt various other devices and controls in an attempt to avert them.
Among these devices are rationing, cost-control, subsidies, and universal
price-fixing. Let us look at each of these in turn.</p>

<p>When it becomes obvious that a shortage of some commodity is developing
as a result of a price fixed below the market, rich consumers are accused of
taking “more than their fair share”; or, if it is a raw material that
enters into manufacture, individual firms are accused of “hoarding” it.
The government then adopts a set of rules concerning who shall have priority
in buying that commodity, or to whom and in what quantities it shall be
allocated, or how it shall be rationed. If a rationing system is adopted, it
means that each consumer can have only a certain maximum supply, no matter
how much he is willing to pay for more.</p>

<p>If a rationing system is adopted, in brief, it means that the government
adopts a double price system, or a dual currency system, in which each
consumer must have a certain number of coupons or “points” in addition
to a given amount of ordinary money. In other words, the government tries to
do through rationing part of the job that a free market would have done
through prices. I say only part of the job, because rationing merely limits
the demand without also stimulating the supply, as a higher price would have
done.</p>

<p>The government may try to assure supply through extending its control
over the costs of production of a commodity. To hold down the retail price
of beef, for example, it may fix the wholesale price of beef, the
slaughter-house price of beef, the price of live cattle, the price of feed,
the wages of farmhands. To hold down the delivered price of milk, it may try
to fix the wages of milk truck drivers, the price of containers, the farm
price of milk, the price of feedstuffs. To fix the price of bread, it may
fix the wages in bakeries, the price of flour, the profits of millers, the
price of wheat, and so on.</p>

<p>But as the government extends this price-fixing backwards, it extends at
the same time the consequences that originally drove it to this course.
Assuming that it has the courage to fix these costs, and is able to enforce
its decisions, then it merely, in turn, creates shortages of the various
factors — labor, feedstuffs, wheat, or whatever—that enter into the
production of the final commodities. Thus the government is driven to
controls in ever-widening circles, and the final consequence will be the
same as that of universal price-fixing.</p>

<p>The government may try to meet this difficulty through subsidies. It
recognizes, for example, that when it keeps the price of milk or butter
below the level of the market, or below the relative level at which it fixes
other prices, a shortage may result because of lower wages or profit margins
for the production of milk or butter as compared with other commodities.
Therefore the government attempts to compensate for this by paying a subsidy
to the milk and butter producers. Passing over the administrative
difficulties involved in this, and assuming that the subsidy is just enough
to assure the desired relative production of milk and butter, it is clear
that, though the subsidy is paid to producers, those who are really being
subsidized are the consumers. For the producers are on net balance getting
no more for their milk and butter than if they had been allowed to charge
the free market price in the first place; but the consumers are getting
their milk and butter at a great deal below the free market price. They are
being subsidized to the extent of the difference—that is, by the amount of
subsidy paid ostensibly to the producers.</p>

<p>Now unless the subsidized commodity is also rationed, it is those with
the most purchasing power that can buy most of it. This means that they are
being subsidized more than those with less purchasing power. Who subsidizes
the consumers will depend upon the incidence of taxation. But men in their
role of taxpayers will be subsidizing themselves in their role of consumers.
It becomes a little difficult to trace in this maze precisely who is
subsidizing whom. What is forgotten is that subsidies are paid for by
someone, and that no method has been discovered by which the community gets
something for nothing.</p>
