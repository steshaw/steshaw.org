<p><span class="intro">Economics is haunted</span> by more fallacies than any other study known to
man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any
case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics,
mathematics or medicine-the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain
economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see,
interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the
long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all
other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in
them, will argue for them plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to
devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general
public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next
to impossible. </p><p

>In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that
spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the
immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to
inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all
groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences. </p><p

>In this lies the whole difference between good economics and bad. The bad economist sees only
what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees
only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and
indirect consequences. The bad economist sees only what the effect of a given policy has been or
will be on one particular group; the good economist inquires also what the effect of the policy
will be on all groups. </p><p

>The distinction may seem obvious. The precaution of looking for all the consequences of a given
policy to everyone may seem elementary. Doesn't everybody know, in his personal life, that there
are all sorts of indulgences delightful at the moment but disastrous in the end? Doesn't every
little boy know that if he eats enough candy he will get sick? Doesn't the fellow who gets drunk
know that he will wake up next morning with a ghastly stomach and a horrible head? Doesn't the
dipsomaniac know that he is ruining his liver and shortening his life? Doesn't the Don Juan know
that he is letting himself in for every sort of risk, from blackmail to disease? Finally, to bring
it to the economic though still personal realm, do not the idler and the spendthrift know, even in
the midst of their glorious fling, that they are heading for a future of debt and poverty? </p><p

>Yet when we enter the field of public economics, these elementary truths are ignored. There are
men regarded today as brilliant economists, who deprecate saving and recommend squandering on a
national scale as the way of economic salvation; and when anyone points to what the consequences
of these policies will be in the long run, they reply flippantly, as might the prodigal son of a
warning father: “In the long run we are all dead.” And such shallow wisecracks pass as devastating
epigrams and the ripest wisdom. </p><p

>But the tragedy is that, on the contrary, we are already suffering the long-run consequences of
the policies of the remote or recent past. Today is already the tomorrow which the bad economist
yesterday urged us to ignore. The long-run consequences of some economic policies may become
evident in a few months. Others may not become evident for several years. Still others may not
become evident for decades. But in every case those long-run consequences are contained in the
policy as surely as the hen was in the egg, the flower in the seed. </p><p

>From this aspect, therefore, the whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that
lesson can be reduced to a single sentence. <em>The art of economics consists in looking not
merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the
consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.</em></p
