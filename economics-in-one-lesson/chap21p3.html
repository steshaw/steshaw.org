<p>But now let us suppose that the increase in wage rates is
accompanied or followed by a sufficient increase in money and
credit to allow it to take place without creating serious
unemployment. If we assume that the previous relationship
between wages and prices was itself a “normal” long-run
relationship, then it is altogether probable that a forced
increase of, say, 30 percent in wage rates will ultimately
lead to an increase in prices of approximately the same
percentage.</p>

<p>The belief that the price increase would be substantially
less than that rests on two main fallacies. The first is that
of looking only at the direct labor costs of a particular firm
or industry and assuming these to represent all the labor
costs involved. But this is the elementary error of mistaking
a part for the whole. Each “industry” represents not only
just one section of the productive process considered
“horizontally,” but just one section of that process
considered “vertically.” Thus the direct labor cost of
making automobiles in the automobile factories themselves may
be less than a third, say, of the total costs; and this may
lead the incautious to conclude that a 30 percent increase in
wages would lead to only a 10 percent increase, or less, in
automobile prices. But this would be to overlook the indirect
wage costs in the raw materials and purchased parts, in
transportation charges, in new factories or new machine tools,
or in the dealers’ mark-up.</p>

<p>Government estimates show that in the fifteen-year period
from 1929 to 1943, inclusive, wages and salaries in the United
States averaged 69 percent of the national income. In the
five-year period 1956—1960 they also averaged 69 percent of
the national income! In the five-year period 1972—1976 wages
and salaries averaged 66 percent of national income, and when
supplements are added, total compensation of employees
averaged 76 percent of national income.<A
href="chap28p1.html#09PM"><sup>[9]</sup></A> These wages and
salaries, of course, had to be paid out of the national
product. While there would have to be both deductions from
these figures and additions to them to provide a fair estimate
of “labor’s” income, we can assume on this basis that
labor costs cannot be less than about two-thirds of total
production costs and may run above three-quarters (depending
upon our definition of labor). If we take the lower of these
two estimates, and assume also that dollar profit margins
would be unchanged, it is clear that an increase of 30 percent
in wage costs all around the circle would mean an increase of
nearly 20 percent in prices.</p>

<p>But such a change would mean that the dollar profit margin
representing the income of investors, managers and the
self-employed, would then have, say, only 84 percent as much
purchasing power as it had before. The long-run effect of this
would be to cause a diminution of investment and new
enterprise compared with what it would otherwise have been,
and consequent transfers of men from the lower ranks of the
self-employed to the higher ranks of wage-earners, until the
previous relationships had been approximately restored. But
this is only another way of saying that a 30 percent increase
in wages under the conditions assumed would eventually mean
also a 30 percent increase in prices.</p>

<p>It does not necessarily follow that wage-earners would make
no relative gains. They would make a relative gain, and other
elements in the population would suffer a relative loss,
<i>during the period of transition. </i>But it is improbable
that this relative gain would mean an absolute gain. For the
kind of change in the relationship of costs to prices
contemplated here could hardly take place without bringing
about unemployment and unbalanced, interrupted or reduced
production. So that while labor might get a wider slice of a
smaller pie, during this period of transition and adjustment
to a new equilibrium, it may be doubted whether this would be
greater in absolute size (and it might easily be less) than
the previous narrower slice of a larger pie.</p>
