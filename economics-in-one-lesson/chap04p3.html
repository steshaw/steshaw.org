<p>I have deliberately chosen
the most favorable examples of public spending schemes—that is, those that are
most frequently and fervently urged by the government spenders and most highly
regarded by the public. I have not spoken of the hundreds of boondoggling
projects that are invariably embarked upon the moment the main object is to “give
jobs” and “to put people to work.” For then the usefulness of the project
itself, as we have seen, inevitably becomes a subordinate consideration.
Moreover, the more wasteful the work, the more costly in manpower, the better
it becomes for the purpose of providing more employment. Under such
circumstances it is highly improbable that the projects thought up by the
bureaucrats will provide the same net addition to wealth and welfare, per
dollar expended, as would have been provided by the taxpayers themselves, if
they had been individually permitted to buy or have made what they themselves
wanted, instead of being forced to surrender part of their earnings to the
state.</p>
