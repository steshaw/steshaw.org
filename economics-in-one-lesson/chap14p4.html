<p>These results are virtually inherent, in fact, in the very arguments put
forward to subsidize the X industry. The X industry is shrinking or dying by
the contention of its friends. Why, it may be asked, should it be kept alive
by artificial respiration? The idea that an expanding economy implies that
<i>all </i>industries must be simultaneously expanding is a profound error.
In order that new industries may grow fast enough it is usually necessary
that some old industries should be allowed to shrink or die. In doing this
they help to release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries.
If we had tried to keep the horse-and-buggy trade artificially alive we
should have slowed down the growth of the automobile industry and all the
trades dependent on it. We should have lowered the production of wealth and
retarded economic and scientific progress.</p>

<p>We do the same thing, however, when we try to prevent any industry from
dying in order to protect the labor already trained or the capital already
invested in it. Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary
to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die
as that growing industries be allowed to grow. The first process is
essential to the second. It is as foolish to try to preserve obsolescent
industries as to try to preserve obsolescent methods of production: this is
often, in fact, merely two ways of describing the same thing. Improved
methods of production must constantly supplant obsolete methods, if both old
needs and new wants are to be filled by better commodities and better
means.</p>
