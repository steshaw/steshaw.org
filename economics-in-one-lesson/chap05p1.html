<p><span class="intro">There is a</span> still further factor
which makes it improbable that the wealth created by
government spending will fully compensate for the wealth
destroyed by the taxes imposed to pay for that spending. It is
not a simple question, as so often supposed, of taking
something out of the nation’s right-hand pocket to put into
its left-hand pocket. The government spenders tell us, for
example, that if the national income is $1,500 billion then
federal taxes of $360 billion a year would mean that only 24
percent of the national income is being transferred from
private purposes to public purposes.<A
href="chap28p1.html#01PM"><sup>[1]</sup></A> This is to talk
as if the country were the same sort of unit of pooled
resources as a huge corporation, and as if all that were
involved were a mere bookkeeping transaction. The government
spenders forget that they are taking the money from A in order
to pay it to B. Or rather, they know this very well but while
they dilate upon all the benefits of the process to B, and all
the wonderful things he will have which he would not have had
if the money had not been transferred to him, they forget the
effects of the transaction on A. B is seen; A is
forgotten.</p>


 <p>In our modern world there is never the same percentage of income
 tax levied on everybody. The great burden of income taxes is imposed
 on a minor percentage of the nation’s income; and these income taxes
have to be supplemented by taxes of other kinds. These taxes inevitably
affect the actions and incentives of those from whom they are taken.
When a corporation loses a hundred cents of every dollar it loses, and
is permitted to keep only fifty-two cents of every dollar it gains, and
when it cannot adequately offset its years of losses against its years
of gains, its policies are affected. It does not expand its operations,
or it expands only those attended with a minimum of risk. People who
recognize this situation are deterred from starting new enterprises.
Thus old employers do not give more employment, or not as much more as
they might have; and others decide not to become employers at all.
Improved machinery and better-equipped factories come into existence
much more slowly than they otherwise would. The result in the long run
is that consumers are prevented from getting better and cheaper
products to the extent that they otherwise would, and that real wages
are held down, compared with what they might have been.</p>

<p>There is a similar effect when personal incomes are
taxed 50, 60 or 70 percent. People begin to ask themselves why they should work
six, eight or nine months of the entire year for the government, and only six,
four or three months for themselves and their families. If they lose the whole
dollar when they lose, but can keep only a fraction of it when they win, they
decide that it is foolish to take risks with their capital. In addition, the
capital available for risk-taking itself shrinks enormously. It is being taxed
away before it can be accumulated. In brief, capital to provide new private
jobs is first prevented from coming into existence, and the part that does come
into existence is then discouraged from starting new enterprises. The
government spenders create the very problem of unemployment that they profess
to solve.</p>

<p>A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable
to carry on essential government functions. Reasonable taxes for this purpose
need not hurt production much. The kind of government services then supplied in
return, which among other things safeguard production itself, more than
compensate for this. But the larger the percentage of the national income taken
by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment. When
the total tax burden grows beyond a bearable size, the problem of devising
taxes that will not discourage and disrupt production becomes insoluble.</p>
