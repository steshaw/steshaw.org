<p>Similar results would follow any attempt to save the X industry by a
direct subsidy out of the public till. This would be nothing more than a
transfer of wealth or income to the X industry. The taxpayers would lose
precisely as much as the people in the X industry gained. The great
advantage of a subsidy, indeed, from the standpoint of the public, is that
it makes this fact so clear. There is far less opportunity for the
intellectual obfuscation that accompanies arguments for tariffs,
minimum-price fixing or monopolistic exclusion.</p>

<p>It is obvious in the case of a subsidy that the taxpayers must lose
precisely as much as the X industry gains. It should be equally clear that,
as a consequence, other industries must lose what the X industry gains. They
must pay part of the taxes that are used to support the X industry. And
customers, because they are taxed to support the X industry, will have that
much less income left with which to buy other things. The result must be
that other industries on the average must be smaller than otherwise in order
that the X industry may be larger.</p>

<p>But the result of this subsidy is not merely that there has been a
transfer of wealth or income, or that other industries have shrunk in the
aggregate as much as the X industry has expanded. The result is also (and
this is where the net loss comes in to the nation considered as a unit) that
capital and labor are driven out of industries in which they are more
efficiently employed to be diverted to an industry in which they are less
efficiently employed. Less wealth is created. The average standard of living
is lowered compared with what it would have been.</p>
