<p><span class="intro">There is no</span> more persistent and
influential faith in the world today than the faith in government spending.
Everywhere government spending is presented as a panacea for all our economic
ills. Is private industry partially stagnant? We can fix it all by government
spending. Is there unemployment? That is obviously due to “insufficient private
purchasing power.” The remedy is just as obvious. All that is necessary is for
the government to spend enough to make up the “deficiency”.</p>

<p>An enormous literature is
based on this fallacy, and, as so often happens with doctrines of this sort, it
has become part of an intricate network of fallacies that mutually support each
other. We cannot explore that whole network at this point; we shall return to
other branches of it later. But we can examine here the mother fallacy that has
given birth to this progeny, the main stem of the network.</p>

<p>Everything we get, outside
of the free gifts of nature, must in some way be paid for. The world is full of
so-called economists who in turn are full of schemes for getting something for
nothing. They tell us that the government can spend and spend without taxing at
all; that is can continue to pile up debt without ever paying it off because
“we owe it to ourselves.” We shall return to such extraordinary doctrines at a
later point. Here I am afraid that we shall have to be dogmatic, and point out
that such pleasant dreams in the past have always been shattered by national
insolvency or a runaway inflation. Here we shall have to say simply that all
government expenditures must eventually be paid out of the proceeds of taxation; that
inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of
taxation.</p>

<p>Having put aside for later
consideration the network of fallacies which rest on chronic government
borrowing and inflation, we shall take it for granted throughout the present
chapter that either immediately or ultimately every dollar of government spending
must be raised through a dollar of taxation. Once we look at the matter in this
way, the supposed miracles of government spending will appear in another light.</p>

<p>A certain amount of public
spending is necessary to perform essential government functions. A certain
amount of public works — of streets and roads and bridges and tunnels, of armories and navy
yards, of buildings to house legislatures, police and fire departments—is
necessary to supply essential public services. With such public works,
necessary for their own sake, and defended on that ground alone, I am not here
concerned. I am here concerned with public works considered as a means of
“providing employment” or of adding wealth to the community that it would not
otherwise have had.</p>

<p>A bridge is built. Ifit is
built to meet an insistent public demand, if it solves a traffic problem or a transportation problem otherwise
insoluble, if, in short, it is even more necessary to the taxpayers
collectively than the things for which they would have individually spent their
money had it had not been taxed away from them, there can be no objection. But
a bridge built primarily “to provide employment” is a different kind of bridge.
When providing employment becomes the end, need becomes a subordinate consideration.
“Projects” have to be <i>invented. </i>Instead
of thinking only of where bridges <i>must </i>be
built the government spenders begin to ask themselves where bridges <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can </i>be built. Can they think of
plausible reasons why an additional bridge should connect Easton and Weston? It
soon becomes absolutely essential. Those who doubt the necessity are dismissed
as obstructionists and reactionaries.</p>

<p>Two arguments are put forward for the bridge, one of which is
mainly heard before it is built, the other of which is mainly
heard after it has been completed. The first argument is that it
will provide employment. It will provide, say, 500 jobs for a
year. The implication is that these are jobs that would not
otherwise have come into existence.</p>

<p>This is what is immediately seen. But if we have trained
ourselves to look beyond immediate to secondary consequences, and
beyond those who are directly benefited by a government project
to others who are indirectly affected, a different picture
presents itself. It is true that a particular group of
bridgeworkers may receive more employment than otherwise. But the
bridge has to be paid for out of taxes. For every dollar that is
spent on the bridge a dollar will be taken away from taxpayers.
If the bridge costs $10 million the taxpayers will lose $10
million. They will have that much taken away from them which they
would otherwise have spent on the things they needed most.</p>

<p>Therefore, for every public job created by the bridge project a
private job has been destroyed somewhere else. We can see the men
employed on the bridge. We can watch them at work. The employment
argument of the government spenders becomes vivid, and probably
for most people convincing. But there are other things that we do
not see, because, alas, they have never been permitted to come
into existence. They are the jobs destroyed by the $10 million
taken from the taxpayers. All that has happened, at best, is that
there has been a <i>diversion</i> of jobs because of the project. More
bridge builders; fewer automobile workers, television
technicians, clothing workers, farmers.</p>

<p>But then we come to the second argument. The bridge exists. It
is, let us suppose, a beautiful and not an ugly bridge. It has come
into being through the magic of government spending. Where would it
have been if the obstructionists and the reactionaries had had their
way? There would have been no bridge. The country would have been
just that much poorer. Here again the government spenders have the
better of the argument with all those who cannot see beyond the
immediate range of their physical eyes. They can see the bridge. But
if they have taught themselves to look for indirect as well as
direct consequences they can once more see in the eye of imagination
the possibilities that have never been allowed to come into
existence. They can see the unbuilt homes, the unmade cars and
washing machines, the unmade dresses and coats, perhaps the ungrown
and unsold foodstuffs. To see these uncreated things requires a kind
of imagination that not many people have. We can think of these
nonexistent objects once, perhaps, but we cannot keep them before
our minds as we can the bridge that we pass every working day. What
has happened is merely that one thing has been created instead of
others.</p>
