<p>Our study of our lesson would not be complete if, before we
took leave of it, we neglected to observe that the fundamental
fallacy with which we have been concerned arises not
accidentally but systematically. It is an almost inevitable
result, in fact, of the division of labor.</p>

<p>In a primitive community, or among pioneers, before the
division of labor has arisen, a man works solely for himself
or his immediate family. What he consumes is identical with
what he produces. There is always a direct and immediate
connection between his output and his satisfactions.</p>

<p>But when an elaborate and minute division of labor has set
in, this direct and immediate connection ceases to exist. I do
not make all the things I consume but, perhaps, only one of
them. With the income I derive from making this one commodity,
or rendering this one service, I buy all the rest. I wish the
price of everything I buy to be low, but it is in my interest
for the price of the commodity or services that I have to sell
to be high. Therefore, though I wish to see abundance in
everything else, it is in my interest for scarcity to exist in
the very thing that it is my business to supply. The greater
the scarcity, compared to everything else, in this one thing
that I supply, the higher will be the reward that I can get
for my efforts.</p>

<p>This does not necessarily mean that I will restrict my own
efforts or my own output. In fact, if I am only one of a
substantial number of people supplying that commodity or
service, and if free competition exists in my line, this
individual restriction will not pay me. On the contrary, if I
am a grower of wheat, say, I want my particular crop to be as
large as possible. But if I am concerned only with my own
material welfare, and have no humanitarian scruples, I want
the output of all <i>other </i>wheat growers to be as <i>low
</i>as possible; for I want scarcity in wheat (and in any
foodstuff that can be substituted for it) so that my
particular crop may command the highest possible price.</p>

<p>Ordinarily these selfish feelings would have no effect on
the total production of wheat. Wherever competition exists, in
fact, each producer is compelled to put forth his utmost
efforts to raise the highest possible crop on his own land. In
this way the forces of self-interest (which, for good or evil,
are more persistently powerful than those of altruism) are
harnessed to maximum output.</p>

<p>But if it is possible for wheat growers or any other group
of producers to combine to eliminate competition, and if the
government permits or encourages such a course, the situation
changes. The wheat growers may be able to persuade the
national government—or, better, a world organization—to
force all of them to reduce pro rata the acreage planted to
wheat. In this way they will bring about a shortage and raise
the price of wheat; and if the rise in the price per bushel is
proportionately greater, as it well may be, than the reduction
in output, then the wheat growers as a whole will be better
off. They will get more money; they will be able to buy more
of everything else. Everybody else, it is true, will be worse
off: because, other things equal, everyone else will have to
give more of what he produces to get less of what the wheat
grower produces. So the nation as a whole will be just that
much poorer. It will be poorer by the amount of wheat that has
not been grown. But those who look only at the wheat farmers
will see a gain, and miss the more than offsetting loss.</p>

<p>And this applies in every other line. If because of unusual
weather conditions there is a sudden increase in the crop of
oranges, all the consumers will benefit. The world will be
richer by that many more oranges. Oranges will be cheaper. But
that very fact may make the orange growers as a group poorer
than before, unless the greater supply of oranges compensates
or more than compensates for the lower price. Certainly if
under such conditions my particular crop of oranges is no
larger than usual, then I am certain to lose by the lower
price brought about by general plenty.</p>

<p>And what applies to changes in supply applies to changes in
demand, whether brought about by new inventions and
discoveries or by changes in taste. A new cotton-picking
machine, though it may reduce the cost of cotton underwear and
shirts to everyone, and increase the general wealth, will mean
the employment of fewer cotton pickers. A new textile machine,
weaving a better cloth at a faster rate, will make thousands
of old machines obsolete, and wipe out part of the capital
value invested in them, so making poorer the owners of those
machines. The further development of nuclear power, though it
can confer unimaginable blessings on mankind, is something
that is dreaded by the owners of coal mines and oil wells.</p>

<p>Just as there is no technical improvement that would not
hurt someone, so there is no change in public taste or morals,
even for the better, that would not hurt someone. An increase
in sobriety would put thousands of bartenders out of business.
A decline in gambling would force croupiers and racing touts
to seek more productive occupations. A growth of male chastity
would ruin the oldest profession in the world.</p>

<p>But it is not merely those who deliberately pander to men s
vices who would be hurt by a sudden improvement in public
morals. Among those who would be hurt most are precisely those
whose business it is to improve those morals. Preachers would
have less to complain about; reformers would lose their
causes; the demand for their services and contributions for
their support would decline.</p>

<p>If there were no criminals we should need fewer lawyers,
judges and firemen, and no jailers, no locksmiths, and (except
for such services as untangling traffic snarls) even no
policemen.</p>

<p>Under a system of division of labor, in short, it is
difficult to think of a greater fulfillment of any human need
which would not, at least temporarily, hurt some of the people
who have made investments or painfully acquired skill to meet
that precise need. If progress were completely even all around
the circle, this antagonism between the interests of the whole
community and of the specialized group would not, if it were
noticed at all, present any serious problem. If in the same
year as the world wheat crop increased, my own crop increased
in the same proportion, if the crop of oranges and all other
agricultural products increased correspondingly, and if the
output of all industrial goods also rose and their unit cost
of production fell to correspond, then I as a wheat grower
would not suffer because the output of wheat had increased.
The price that I got for a bushel of wheat might decline. The
total sum that I realized from my larger output might decline.
But if I could also because of increased supplies buy the
output of everyone else cheaper, then I should have no real
cause to complain. If the price of everything else dropped in
exactly the same ratio as the decline in the price of my
wheat, I should be better off, in fact, exactly in proportion
to my increased total crop; and everyone else, likewise, would
benefit proportionately from the in creased supplies of all
goods and services.</p>

<p>But economic progress never has taken place and probably
never will take place in this completely uniform way. Advance
occurs now in this branch of production and now in that. And
if there is a sudden increase in the supply of the thing I
help to produce, or if a new invention or discovery makes what
I produce no longer necessary, then the gain to the world is a
tragedy to me and to the productive group to which I
belong.</p>

<p>Now it is often not the diffused gain of the increased
supply or new discovery that most forcibly strikes even the
disinterested observer, but the concentrated loss. The fact
that there is more and cheaper coffee for everyone is lost
sight of; what is seen is merely that some coffee growers
cannot make a living at the lower price. The increased output
of shoes at lower cost by the new machine is forgotten; what
is seen is a group of men and women thrown out of work. It is
altogether proper—it is, in fact, essential to a full
understanding of the problem—that the plight of these groups
be recognized, that they be dealt with sympathetically, and
that we try to see whether some of the gains from this
specialized progress cannot be used to help the victims find a
productive role elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily,
to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support
people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its
value. Yet this is what the world has repeatedly sought to do
by protective tariffs, by the destruction of machinery, by the
burning of coffee, by a thousand restriction schemes. This is
the insane doctrine of wealth through scarcity.</p>

<p>It is a doctrine that may always be privately true,
unfortunately, for any particular group of producers
considered in isolation — if they can make scarce the one
thing they have to sell while keeping abundant all the things
they have to buy. But it is a doctrine that is always publicly
false. It can never be applied all around the circle. For its
application would mean economic suicide.</p>

<p>And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For
many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a
single economic group are seen to be illusions when the
interests of everyone, as consumer no less than as producer,
are considered.</p>

<p>To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that
is the goal of economic science.</p>
