If you're interested in the Scala programming language then [this article](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/steps.html) will come in handy. I learned a couple of things. In particular, I didn't realise that you could instantiate an object with a trait (effectively changing the trait from the one specified in the class definition). Very interested in how that is implemented.
