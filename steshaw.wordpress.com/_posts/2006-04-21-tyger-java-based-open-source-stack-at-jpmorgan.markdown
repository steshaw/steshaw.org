Tyger is JPMorgan's open source stack for Java applications. Check out the following article - [JPMorgan's 'Tyger' Roars Ahead](http://www.watersonline.com/public/showPage.html?page=322256). Tyger is based Apache+Tomcat, Spring, Maven, and Hibernate or iBatis for RDBMS integration. It's good to see that the banks take open source seriously.
