I have just today come across two excellent Australian resources.  
  
The [bubblepedia](http://bubblepedia.net.au) front page describes why "[It's a crazy idea to buy a house in Australia at the current prices](http://bubblepedia.net.au)", blows away the myth of the housing shortage and answers many common questions to the nay sayers.  
  
The [Contrarian Investors' Journal](http://cij.inspiriting.com) seems to be a economics commentary with an Austrian Economics slant (i.e. not a mainstream economics viewpoint). I have been on a journey of late into Austrian Economics and Libertarianism. It started with videos such as "[Money as debt](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279&hl=en&CFID=161233&CFTOKEN=5080a25a729e7585-24062F61-FF70-A07E-9CE8F916A29166B7)" and "[The money masters](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-515319560256183936&q=money+masters)" which introduce the little known facts about where money comes from. I'm currently finding free resources from the [Mises Institute](http://mises.org/) very interesting. The Contrarian Investors' Journal provides a much needed Australian perspective as much of the information available about the Austrian/Libertarian economics viewpoint is from a purely American perspective.
