Domain.com.au's article "[Property crash not likely](http://www.domain.com.au/Public/Article.aspx?id=1212258693809&index=NationalIndex&headline=Property%20crash%20not%20likely)" only helps convince me that the bust is already on the way :). ABC's MediaWatch have reported that [the "rental crisis" may not be as bad as all that](http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1857681.htm). Domain's article does say there's a "tight rental market" particularly in Brisbane (but it's Sydney where we have seen all the footage on TV!). It seems however that this is the real estate agents pushing this line in the news. Trying to make the last few easy dollars out of bubble. They say that increasing rents would lead to investors gaining interest again however the rental yields would still be below average even if rents go up 50% over the next 2-3 years! And once the "full employment" myth is blown away that will have it's affect on confidence along with making future immigrants reconsider their options ;).
