I played around with WebStart this weekend to get my first WebStarted Swing app up and going. Click here to [Click here to start](http://abstractsimplicity.org/FirstWebStart/FirstWebStart.jnlp). It's signed but uses the PersistenceService anyway to save the contents of the editor pane between invocations. The lower pane is a my debug console :).
