I can't say that I agree with everything that Steve Keen says but I sure enjoyed his talk entitled "Wowsernomics - the madness behind modern economics theory, policy and practice". Here he attacks neoclassical economics and it's idea of equilibrium. He likens modern economics to religion. I agree with Steve Keen on that score - economics is like religion or ideology. i.e. you have to "believe" in one view or another e.g. you are either a lefty or a righty.  
  
  
  
I am not certain that a theory of economics can be completely addressed mathematically i.e. how the human response can be modelled accurately. Much of economic policy is driven by politics. Before listening to this lecture I had assumed that economists' used uncertainty in their models but apparently not. It would be great to see a computer simulation of the economy to see if it supports the Austrian view (something like the flocking algorithms that games programmers sometimes use).  
  
I still don’t know what the idea of economic equilibrium is. The Austrian’s don’t seem to talk about it. The [Mises Institute](http://mises.org/) recently produced a [Stabilisation is Chaos T-Shirt](http://blog.mises.org/archives/008660.asp). They seem to be believe that the market “chaos” is superior to government stabilisation.  
  
It's a shame that some of the audio is cut off at the end. Some audience questions are missing :(
