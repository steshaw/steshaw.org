The credit crisis (which should be called a debt crisis) is hitting the news in a big way here in Australia again. People are tending to think that the crunch has "hit" already last week or perhaps that this is the "second hit". However, I get the feeling that we are all on the beach watching the tide go way out. Perhaps we come across a few insolvent US investment banks in the wet sand. Don't just sit there! Get off the beach and head inland at pace!  
  
What does this mean for Brisbane property prices? I can only imagine that the recent news will at least give buyers pause. A sustained pause would be enough to melt away a few percentage points. I've seen recent commentary which [puts the bottom of the market ahead in 2010](http://www.propertywire.com/news/australasia/house-prices-australia-bottom-out-200809171656.html). I figure that's a little optimistic and that the property market slump will be somewhat more sustained than that - say bottom in 2012.
