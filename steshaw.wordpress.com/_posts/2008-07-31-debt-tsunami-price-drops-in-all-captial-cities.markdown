See article on Bloomberg entitled [Australia Facing `Once-in-100-Year' Housing Slump](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aViK6htPFKgM).  
  
The data from Residex showed that there were prices drops between 0.6% and 2.2% across Australian capital cities. The median Australian house dropped 3%. One analyst predicts 30% drops by 2010 and a spokesperson from the Salvation Army calls it a "debt tsunami". The tide certainly does seem to be heading out a long way...  
  
Note that the article does not mention which month the Residex data is for. i.e. May, June or July. I imagine it's June.
