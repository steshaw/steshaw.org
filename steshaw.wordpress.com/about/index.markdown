A computer programmer living in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. An industry veteran with 20 years professional experience using languages such as C, C++, Microsoft Visual Basic, Borland Delphi Object Pascal, Sun Java, Microsoft C#, Scala and Objective-C. Languages that I'm looking to use professionally include Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Microsoft F#, Erlang and Standard ML.

Also having about 10 years of amateur experience prior to joining the profession going back to BASIC on the [Dick Smith Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in [82](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbCr15KkBxY) and text-based adventures (aka "go north; get chalice") and 2D sprite games (e.g. Snakes and Lunar Lander) in BASIC and machine code on the [C=64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) ;). Never could quite afford an upgrade to an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) (or later models but a few friends had A500s) and finally ended up with a DR-DOS PC _after_ university — I spent a _lot_ of time in the computer lab :). In those days, I was quite partial to [VAX/VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and it's [DCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language) shell scripting language but that was before I was introduced to UNIX it's Borne and eventually Korn Shells.
