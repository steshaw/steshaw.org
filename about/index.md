  <h1>About</h1>
</header>

Born English. Grew up Australian. Dual citizen. Enjoys living in beautiful Brisbane but does still feel the tug of Ol' Blighty — particularly Scotland and my home town near Nottingham.

I'm an avid computer programmer, an industry veteran with 25 years experience using languages such as (in order of first use): C, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Scala.

I also had a lot of fun with computers prior to joining the industry — 10 years
amateur experience going back to BASIC on the [Dick Smith Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in [82](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbCr15KkBxY) and text-based adventures (aka "go north; get chalice") and 2D sprite games (e.g. Snakes and Lunar Lander) in BASIC and machine code on the [C=64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) ;). Never could quite afford an upgrade to an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) (or later models but a few friends had A500s) and finally ended up with a DR-DOS PC _after_ university — I spent a _lot_ of time in the computer lab :). In those days, I was quite partial to [VAX/VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and it's [DCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language) shell scripting language but that was before I was introduced to UNIX with it's Borne and eventually Korn shells.

Programming Languages that I seek to use these days include [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) and [PureScript](http://purescript.org/).


## Interests

  - the design and implementation of programming languages, runtime systems and operating systems – very similar beasts!
  - app development — trade offs, tricks, patterns, dogma, philosophy and coffee.
  - distributed systems - cloud, web, messaging, middleware and highly-scalable servers.
  - database systems and persistence — RDBMS, NoSQL, NewSQL and database APIs.
  - computer games — 2D/3D graphics, scripting engines, AI.


## Hobbies

  - human languages such as Spanish and French.
