# Steve's Backstory
</header>

Born English. Grew up Australian. Dual citizen. Enjoys living in beautiful
Brisbane but does still feel the tug of Ol' Blighty — particularly Scotland
and my home town near Nottingham.

I'm an avid computer programmer who loves programming languages. As an
industry veteran of 25 years, I've used an multitude of languages: C, AWK,
Perl, Delphi Object Pascal, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Scala.

While I was using those languages in industry, I was learning about all sorts of
other languages:
[Component Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Pascal),
[Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)),
[Oberon-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon-2),

[F#](https://fsharp.org/),
[Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/),

[Haxe](https://haxe.org/),
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/),
[TypeScript](http://typescript.org/),
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/),
[Swift](https://swift.org/),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Of course, my depth of study varied greatly. In fact, most of these languages
I have learnt only superficially, often from research papers or books alone.

Thankfully, I'm working primarily in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) at
the moment. I also like [Idris](http://idris-lang.org),
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/), and
[Scala](https://scala-lang.org/). I'd definitely take on
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) too, given the opportunity. I've more-or-less
given up using [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/)—though I still follow along
with developments from time to time. I haven't really gotten into
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) as yet—though it looks enticing.
Unfortunately, [Idris](http://idris-lang.org) isn't ready for prime time, but
I'm hopeful that this could change with the advent of [Idris
2.0](https://github.com/edwinb/Blodwen/), and if a production-ready
runtime-system materialises. I've done a bit of introductory work with
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and
[Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) and have found it
tough going. Wish I had more time to try out
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for systems programming or gamedev.


### Formative Years

</div>

I enjoyed programming for about 10 years prior to joining the industry. I had heaps of fun starting with with Basic on the [Dick Smith Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in [82](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbCr15KkBxY). By the time I got a [C=64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), I was writing text-based adventures (aka "go north; get chalice") in Basic, 2D sprite games in assembly, and experimenting with electronic music composition. I regret never upgrading to an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) as it seemed like an awesome platform for writing [video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsuWgLEQBxM), [demos](https://youtu.be/3wu8cnIpdLY?list=PL7C791DD55914C154) and [compilers](http://strlen.com/amiga-e). I didn't own a PC until _after_ university. While I was studying, I was fond of the terminal labs. At the time, I was quite partial to [VAX/VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and it's [DCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language) shell scripting language until I was introduced to UNIX with it's Borne and eventually Korn shells.


### Interests

  - Programming languages: Type theory, Category theory, Logic/proof theory (TLC).
  - Apps---trade-offs, tricks, patterns, big-picture, dogma-slaying, and philosophy.
  - Systems:
    - Runtime systems and operating systems---very similar beasts!
    - Distributed systems---cloud, web, messaging, middleware, and highly-scalable servers.
    - Database systems---SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, and APIs (e.g. LINQ).
    - Build systems---GNU Make, [Cook](http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/software/cook/), [SCons](http://www.scons.org/), [Vesta](http://www.vestasys.org/), Ant, Maven, Ivy, SBT, Cabal, Shake, Nix. My interest was originally piqued by Peter Miller's [Recursive Make Considered Harmful](http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf).
    - Version Control Systems---RCS, CVS, Subversion, [Aegis](http://aegis.sourceforge.net/), [GNU] arch, [Vesta](http://www.vestasys.org/), [Darcs](http://darcs.net/), [Mercurial](https://mercurial.selenic.com/), [[GNU] Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Veracity](http://veracity-scm.com/) (with integrated bug tracking and wiki), [Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org/) (with integrated bug tracking, wiki and technical notes).


### Hobbies

  - Programming Languages---Types, Logic, Categories (TLC).
  - Human languages---such as Spanish and French.
