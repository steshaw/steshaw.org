# Backstory
</header>

Born English. Grew up Australian. Dual citizen. Enjoys living in beautiful Brisbane but does still feel the tug of Ol' Blighty — particularly Scotland and my home town near Nottingham.

I'm an avid computer programmer who loves programming languages. As an industry veteran of 25 years, I've used the following languages: C, AWK, Perl, Delphi Object Pascal, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Scala.

While I was using those languages in industry, I was learning about all sorts of other languages: Component Pascal, Oberon, Oberon-2, Modula-3, Mesa, ALGOL, Eiffel, Sather, CLU, Smalltalk, Scheme, Goo, Dylan, EuLisp, Racket, Common Lisp, [Shen](http://www.shenlanguage.org/), [Slate](http://slatelanguage.org/), [Io](http://iolanguage.org/), Factor, Objective-C, APL, J, K, Prolog, Caml, OCaml, F#, Standard ML, Mythryl, Mozart Oz, Alice ML, Erlang, Haskell, Idris, Coq, Agda, Ur, ATS, F\*, Haxe, Elm, TypeScript, PureScript, Swift. Of course, my depth of study varied greatly. In fact, most of these languages I have learnt only superficially, often from research papers or books alone.

Languages that I seek to use include [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [Scala](http://scala-lang.org), [PureScript](http://purescript.org/), and (as soon as it's ready) [Idris](http://idris-lang.org).

### Formative Years

I enjoyed programming for about 10 years prior to joining the industry. I had heaps of fun starting with with Basic on the [Dick Smith Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in [82](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbCr15KkBxY). By the time I got a [C=64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), I was writing text-based adventures (aka "go north; get chalice") in Basic, 2D sprite games in assembly, and experimenting with electronic music composition. I regret never upgrading to an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) as it seemed like an awesome platform for writing [video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsuWgLEQBxM), [demos](https://youtu.be/3wu8cnIpdLY?list=PL7C791DD55914C154) and [compilers](http://strlen.com/amiga-e). I didn't own a PC until _after_ university. While I was studying, I was fond of the terminal labs. At the time, I was quite partial to [VAX/VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and it's [DCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language) shell scripting language until I was introduced to UNIX with it's Borne and eventually Korn shells.


## Interests

  - programming languages, runtime systems and operating systems – very similar beasts!
  - appdev — trade-offs, tricks, patterns, big-picture, dogma-slaying, philosophy and coffee.
  - distributed systems - cloud, web, messaging, middleware and highly-scalable servers.
  - database systems — SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, and APIs (e.g. LINQ).


## Hobbies

  - Human languages such as Spanish and French.
  - gamedev — game engines, graphics, scripting engines, AI, optimisation.
