## Understanding me

These personality/temperament profiles may help you to understand me. Many years ago, I did the 
[Keirsey Temperament Sorter](http://keirsey.com/). The result was 
[INTJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html "INTJ - Mastermind/Scientist") for both.

Later, I took a standard Myer-Briggs test which came up with 
[INTP](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html "INTP - Architect/Thinker"). Apparently, this is quite the typical profile for a computer programmer.
