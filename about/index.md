  <h1>About</h1>
</header>

Born English. Grew up Australian. Dual citizen. Enjoys living in beautiful Brisbane but does still feel the tug of Ol' Blighty — particularly Scotland and my home town near Nottingham.

I'm an avid computer programmer who loves programming language. As an industry veteran of 25 years, I've used the following languages (in order of first use): C, Awk, Perl, [Delphi Object] Pascal, C++, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Scala. While I was using those languages in industry, I was learning about the following languages in my own time: Component Pascal, Oberon, Oberon-2, Modula-3, Mesa, ALGOL, Eiffel, Sather, CLU, Smalltalk, Scheme, Goo, Dylan, EuLisp, Racket, Common Lisp, Objective-C, APL, J, K, Factor, Prolog, Caml, OCaml, Standard ML, Mythryl, Mozart Oz, Alice ML, Erlang, Haskell, Idris, Coq, Agda, Ur, ATS, Haxe, Elm, TypeScript, PureScript, Swift and probably a few more (let me know if I've missed something). My learning varied greatly in depth of course :).

I also had a lot of fun with computers prior to joining the industry — 10 years
amateur experience going back to BASIC on the [Dick Smith Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in [82](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbCr15KkBxY) and text-based adventures (aka "go north; get chalice") and 2D sprite games (e.g. Snakes and Lunar Lander) in BASIC and machine code on the [C=64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) ;). Never could quite afford an upgrade to an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) (or later models but a few friends had A500s) and finally ended up with a DR-DOS PC _after_ university — I spent a _lot_ of time in the computer lab :). In those days, I was quite partial to [VAX/VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and it's [DCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language) shell scripting language but that was before I was introduced to UNIX with it's Borne and eventually Korn shells.


Programming Languages that I seek to use these days include [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) and [PureScript](http://purescript.org/).


## Interests

  - programming languages, runtime systems and operating systems – very similar beasts!
  - appdev — trade offs, tricks, big picture, long-term, dogma resistance, philosophy and coffee.
  - distributed systems - cloud, web, messaging, middleware and highly-scalable servers.
  - database systems — RDBMS, NoSQL, NewSQL and database APIs.
  - gamedev — game engine architecture, graphics, scripting engines, AI, PLs, optimisation.


## Hobbies

  - Human languages such as Spanish and French.
