## Understanding me

These personality profiles may help you to understand me (though they're a little dated now). I've worked through the [Keirsey Temperament Sorter](http://keirsey.com/) a couple of times. The result was [INTJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html "INTJ - Mastermind/Scientist") for both:

* [Keirsey Temperament Sorter II Results](kcs2.html)

In 2002, I took a standard Myer-Briggs test which came up with
[INTP](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html "INTP - Architect/Thinker"). I was told that this is quite a typical profile for a computer programmer.
