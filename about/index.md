# Steve's Backstory

Born English. Grew up Australian — got the accent to prove it. Dual citizen.
I enjoy living in beautiful Brisbane but do still feel the tug of Ol'
Blighty — particularly my home town in Derbyshire.

I'm an avid computer programmer who loves programming languages. As an
industry veteran, I've used a multitude of languages professionally:
Ingres 4GL (don't ask),
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29),
[Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell),
[Korn Shell](http://kornshell.org/),
[AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK),
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/),
[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[Delphi Object Pascal](http://delphi.wikia.com/wiki/Object_Pascal),
[C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++.html),
[Python](https://www.python.org/),
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29),

[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/),

[Haskell][haskell].

Privately, I was learning about all sorts of other languages to varying
degrees:
[Component Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Pascal),
[Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language)),
[Oberon-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon-2),

[J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)),
[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)),
[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)),
[Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog),
[Caml](https://caml.inria.fr/),
[OCaml][OCaml],
[F#](https://fsharp.org/),
[Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/),
[Mythryl](https://mythryl.org/),
[Mozart Oz](https://mozart.github.io/),
[Alice ML](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice/),

[Haxe](https://haxe.org/),
[Elm][elm],
[TypeScript](http://typescript.org/),
[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/),
[Swift](https://swift.org/), and
[Rust][rust].

I'm currently working with [Haskell][haskell]. I like other
contemporary languages such as [Rust][rust], [PureScript][purescript],
[Elm][elm], and [OCaml][ocaml]. Additionally other research languages such
as [Idris][idris] (with [version 2][Idris2] currently in development) and [ATS][ats]
(with version 3 currently in development). I'm less connected with
[Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) these days — though I still follow along
with developments from time to time. I've done a bit of introductory work
with [Coq][Coq] and [Agda][Agda] and have found it quite challenging.


## Formative Years

I had heaps of fun starting with Basic on the [Dick Smith
Wizard](http://ultimateconsoledatabase.com/others/dick_smith_wizzard.htm) in
[82](https://youtu.be/JbCr15KkBxY). Then on the [Commodore
64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), I wrote text-based
adventures in Basic, 2D sprite games in 6502
assembly, and experimented with electronic music composition. I regret not
being about to afford to upgrade to a [Commodore
Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) as it was an excellent platform
for writing [video](https://youtu.be/rsuWgLEQBxM)
[games](https://youtu.be/cdGaZ8Fakok),
[demos](https://youtu.be/3wu8cnIpdLY?list=PL7C791DD55914C154) and
[compilers](http://strlen.com/amiga-e).

## Interests

### Programming Languages

I love programming languages and what makes them tick. Earlier, I studied
compilers and runtime system techniques. Lately, I've been studying
[Programming Language Theory](https://steshaw.org/plt/) in my spare time. I
dub it the study of TLC --- Types, Logic, and Categories.

### Software Engineering

Trade-offs, tricks, patterns, the big picture, dogma-slaying, and coffee.

### Systems

- Operating Systems and runtime systems---very similar beasts!

- Distributed systems: cloud, web, messaging, and middleware.

- Database systems: SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, OODBMS, and APIs/DSLs.

- Build systems:
  [Make][gnu-make],
  [Cook][cook],
  [SCons][scons],
  [Waf](https://waf.io/),
  [Vesta](http://vesta.sourceforge.net/),
  [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake),
  [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/),
  [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/),
  [Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/),
  [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/),
  [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/),
  [CMake](https://cmake.org/),
  [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/),
  [Shake](https://shakebuild.com/),
  [Tup](http://gittup.org/tup/),
  [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/),
  [Redo](https://cr.yp.to/redo.html),
  [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/),
  [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/),
  [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), and
  [Please](https://please.build/).
  My interest was piqued initially by Peter Miller's [Recursive Make
  Considered Harmful][recursive-make]. Then rekindled recently with the
  publication of [Non-recursive Make Considered Harmful][non-recursive-make]
  — though it fails to mention Miller's [Cook][cook] — and [Build systems à
  la carte][build-systems-a-la-carte].

- Version Control Systems:
  [SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System),
  [RCS](https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/),
  [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/),
  [Aegis](http://aegis.sourceforge.net/),
  [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/),
  [Vesta](http://www.vestasys.org/),
  [arch](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/),
  [Monotone](https://github.com/graydon/monotone),
  [Darcs](http://darcs.net/),
  [Mercurial](https://mercurial.selenic.com/),
  [Bazaar](https://bazaar.canonical.com/),
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
  [Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org/),
  [Veracity](http://veracity-scm.com/), and
  [Pijul](https://pijul.org/).
  Of the distributed version control systems, I preferred to use Mercurial.
  Of course, Git became prominent, and there was no resisting
  it. I have hopes that a better system becomes prominent — perhaps one
  based on a _theory of patches_ like Darcs and Pijul (but over a tokenised
  or abstract syntax representation).

## Hobbies

Reading and human languages.
